# MIGRATION COMPLETION STATUS
**Date**: 2025-10-20 (Post-Agent Assessment)
**Overall**: 35% COMPLETE ‚ùå (Down from claimed 70%)

## üî¥ CRITICAL BLOCKERS DISCOVERED

### 1. Enrichment Infrastructure Removed (Oct 14)
**Commit**: `ac46c971` - "Got rid of all the entityidentity wrapper code"

**Deleted Files**:
- `scripts/utils/company_resolver.py` (392 lines)
- `config/gate_config.json`
- `config/paths.json`
- `config/company_aliases.json`
- Multiple test files (2,977 total lines removed)

**Impact**: Cannot re-enrich 310 relationships to populate gates

**Why It Happened**: Intentional refactoring to use entityidentity library directly (without wrappers)

**To Fix**: Either:
- Option A: Restore infrastructure from git history (`5e1f88fb`)
- Option B: Reimplement using entityidentity directly
- Option C: Manual gate assignment based on confidence scores

---

### 2. Pipeline Only 20% Complete
**Script**: `scripts/pipeline_ingest.py`

**Working**:
- ‚úÖ Step 1: Parse TXT ‚Üí Facility JSONs (`import_from_report.py`)
  - Tested with Albania: 3 facilities created successfully
  - Bugs #1 and #3 fixed during testing

**Broken/Missing**:
- ‚ùå Step 2: `normalize_mentions.py` - Script doesn't exist
- ‚ùå Step 3: `enrich_companies.py` - Import error (missing company_resolver)
- ‚ùå Step 4: `export_review_pack.py` - Script doesn't exist
- ‚ùå Step 5: `migration/wave_metrics.py` - Script doesn't exist

**Impact**: Cannot run end-to-end ingest workflow

---

### 3. 100% Data Loss in company_mentions
**Discovery**: ALL 8,607 facilities have empty company_mentions arrays

**Previous Claim**: "BRA has 101/248 (40.7%) with mentions" ‚Üí FALSE
**Reality**: 0/8,607 (0%) have mentions

**Root Cause**: Original CSV‚ÜíJSON migration never extracted "Group Names" column

**Recovery Available**:
- ‚úÖ 4,196 facilities (48.8%) can be backfilled from Mines.csv
- ‚úÖ 13,620 company mentions recoverable
- ‚úÖ Tool ready: `scripts/backfill_mentions.py`
- ‚è≥ Waiting for execution approval

---

## ‚úÖ WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS

### 1. Legacy Field Migration - 100%
- ‚úÖ Removed `operator_link`/`owner_links` from 1,341 facilities
- ‚úÖ All Wave 1 countries (BRA, IND, RUS, CHL, PER) migrated
- ‚úÖ Pre-commit hook enforces repo-wide ban
- ‚úÖ Verified: 0 occurrences of banned fields

**Note**: This removed empty fields (no data loss), but didn't add company_mentions

---

### 2. Schema Cleanup - 100%
- ‚úÖ All facilities follow canonical structure
- ‚úÖ JSON Schema validation working
- ‚úÖ Pre-commit guards prevent regression

---

### 3. Import Pipeline (Step 1 Only) - 100%
- ‚úÖ `import_from_report.py` works perfectly
- ‚úÖ Tested with Albania: 3 facilities created
- ‚úÖ Parses TXT reports ‚Üí structured JSON
- ‚úÖ Handles duplicates correctly

---

### 4. Backfill Tool - 100% Ready
- ‚úÖ `scripts/backfill_mentions.py` created (351 lines)
- ‚úÖ Dry-run tested on all countries
- ‚úÖ Safe (automatic backups)
- ‚úÖ Can recover 13,620 mentions from 4,196 facilities

## üìä REVISED METRICS

### Gate Population
| Status | Count | % |
|--------|-------|---|
| With gates | 16 | 5% |
| Without gates (None) | 310 | 95% |
| **CAN'T FIX**: Infrastructure removed | | ‚ùå |

### Pipeline Completion
| Step | Status | Completion |
|------|--------|-----------|
| 1. Parse TXT | ‚úÖ Working | 100% |
| 2. Normalize | ‚ùå Missing | 0% |
| 3. Enrich | ‚ùå Broken | 0% |
| 4. Export Review | ‚ùå Missing | 0% |
| 5. Metrics | ‚ùå Missing | 0% |
| **Overall** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | **20%** |

### Data Recovery
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Facilities with mentions | 0 / 8,607 (0%) |
| Recoverable from CSV | 4,196 (48.8%) |
| Mentions available | 13,620 |
| Backfill tool status | ‚úÖ Ready |

### Coverage (Cannot Measure - No Gates)
| Country | Relationships | Gates | Coverage |
|---------|--------------|-------|----------|
| BRA | 29 | 14 have gates | N/A |
| IND | varies | mostly None | N/A |
| All | 326 total | 310 = None | ‚ùå Can't enrich |

## üéØ ACTUAL vs CLAIMED COMPLETION

### Original Assessment (Pre-Agent)
```
Overall: 70% COMPLETE
- Infrastructure: ‚úÖ 100%
- Data migration: ‚ö†Ô∏è 5%
```

### Reality (Post-Agent)
```
Overall: 35% COMPLETE ‚ùå
- Infrastructure: ‚ùå REMOVED (0%)
- Data migration: 0% (all mentions empty)
- Working tools: ‚úÖ 3/5 (backfill, import, cleanup)
```

---

## üö® WHY COMPLETION IS IMPOSSIBLE

The original plan assumed:
1. ‚úÖ Enrichment infrastructure exists ‚Üí FALSE (deleted Oct 14)
2. ‚úÖ Pipeline scripts exist ‚Üí FALSE (only Step 1)
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Some facilities have mentions ‚Üí FALSE (0%)

**You cannot complete the plan without**:
1. Restoring or reimplementing enrichment infrastructure
2. Implementing Steps 2-5 of the pipeline
3. Running the backfill (this one is ready)

---

## üîß PATH TO COMPLETION

### Phase 1: Data Recovery (READY NOW)
```bash
# Execute backfill to get from 0% ‚Üí 48.8% coverage
python scripts/backfill_mentions.py
```

### Phase 2: Restore Enrichment (BLOCKED)
**Option A**: Use git history
```bash
git checkout 5e1f88fb  # Before infrastructure removal
# Run enrichment for all countries
git checkout main
```

**Option B**: Reimplement with entityidentity
- Rebuild company_resolver.py using entityidentity directly
- Recreate gate_config.json
- Update enrich_companies.py

**Option C**: Manual gate assignment
```python
# Update gates based on confidence scores
df['gate'] = pd.cut(df['confidence'],
    bins=[0, 0.75, 0.90, 1.0],
    labels=['pending', 'review', 'auto_accept'])
```

### Phase 3: Complete Pipeline (NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION)
- Implement `normalize_mentions.py`
- Fix `enrich_companies.py` imports
- Implement `export_review_pack.py`
- Implement `wave_metrics.py`

---

## üìÅ FILES CREATED (NOT COMMITTED)

### Tools Ready to Use:
1. ‚úÖ `scripts/backfill_mentions.py` (351 lines) - Backfill company_mentions from CSV
2. ‚úÖ `scripts/verify_backfill.py` - Check mention coverage before/after
3. ‚úÖ `scripts/migrate_legacy_fields.py` (242 lines) - Remove banned fields
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è `scripts/pipeline_ingest.py` (178 lines) - Only Step 1 works

### Documentation:
1. ‚úÖ `BACKFILL_ANALYSIS.md` - 32-page deep dive
2. ‚úÖ `BACKFILL_SUMMARY.md` - Quick reference
3. ‚úÖ `MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md` - **INACCURATE** (needs correction)
4. ‚úÖ `COMPLETION_STATUS.md` - This file (accurate status)

### Test Artifacts:
- `facilities/ALB/alb-vlah-n-mine-fac.json` (real facility)
- `facilities/ALB/alb-mamez-deposit-fac.json` (real facility)
- `facilities/ALB/alb-test-new-facility-fac.json` (test facility)
- `output/import_logs/import_report_ALB_20251020_103704.json`

## üèÅ HONEST VERDICT

**Status**: 35% COMPLETE (Not 70%)

**What Works**:
- ‚úÖ Schema is clean
- ‚úÖ Import tool works
- ‚úÖ Backfill tool ready
- ‚úÖ Pre-commit protection active

**What Doesn't Work**:
- ‚ùå Enrichment infrastructure (deleted)
- ‚ùå Pipeline (80% missing)
- ‚ùå 100% of mentions empty
- ‚ùå 95% of gates not populated

**Grade**: D+ (down from claimed B+)
- Code quality: B (tools work)
- Data completeness: F (0% mentions, 5% gates)
- Documentation accuracy: D (claimed 70%, actually 35%)

**Recommendation**:
1. Execute backfill immediately (0% ‚Üí 48.8%)
2. Decide on enrichment strategy (restore vs reimplement)
3. Correct MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md
4. Complete or remove unimplemented pipeline steps

**As of 2025-10-20**: The system is NOT production-ready. Critical infrastructure was removed mid-migration, leaving the project in a partially-working state.
