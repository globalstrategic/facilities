Algeria's Mining and Minerals Sector: An Exhaustive Asset and Infrastructure Report
Strategic Overview of Algeria's Mining Sector Renaissance
The Algerian mining and minerals sector is undergoing a period of unprecedented, state-driven transformation. Long overshadowed by the nation's dominant hydrocarbon industry, mining is now being elevated as a central pillar of a national strategy to diversify the economy, reduce import dependency, and establish Algeria as a significant industrial power in the Mediterranean and African regions. This strategic shift is underpinned by the development of several world-class "mega-projects" designed to create vertically integrated value chains, from ore extraction to the production of high-value finished goods. This section provides a strategic overview of the policies, regulatory frameworks, and state-owned entities orchestrating this industrial renaissance.

The National Strategy: From Hydrocarbons to Hard Rock
For decades, Algeria's economic fortunes have been inextricably linked to the volatile global markets for oil and natural gas. In a decisive policy pivot, the government, under the leadership of President Abdelmadjid Tebboune since 2019, has identified the development of its vast, untapped mineral wealth as a national strategic priority. This initiative is not merely an economic diversification plan but is framed as a matter of sovereign industrial policy, aimed at capturing maximum value within Algeria's borders and enhancing national self-sufficiency, particularly in critical industrial inputs like steel and agricultural inputs like fertilizers.   

The cornerstone of this strategy is the "mega-project" approach, which focuses on developing globally significant mineral deposits through integrated projects that encompass mining, processing, and manufacturing. The three flagship initiatives at the forefront of this policy are:

The Gara Djebilet iron ore project in the western Sahara, intended to supply a new generation of steel plants.   

The integrated phosphate project, centered on the Bled El Hadba mine, designed to make Algeria a leading global exporter of fertilizers.   

The Tala Hamza (Oued Amizour) zinc-lead project, positioned to capitalize on growing global demand for base metals.   

These projects are viewed by the state not as standalone mines but as catalysts for broader regional development, requiring massive investment in supporting infrastructure such as railways, power plants, and new industrial zones.   

The Evolving Regulatory and Investment Landscape
To facilitate this ambitious agenda, Algeria has been actively reforming its legal and regulatory framework to attract the necessary foreign capital and technical expertise. A new mining law has been introduced with the goal of creating a more favorable and streamlined environment for investors, offering a range of incentives to encourage participation in the sector. The Agence Nationale des Activités Minières (ANAM) serves as the central regulatory body, responsible for managing mining titles and overseeing the tendering process for new exploration and exploitation permits.   

Despite this push for foreign investment, the state maintains a firm grip on its strategic assets. The development model being pursued is not one of wholesale privatization but rather a form of state-capitalism. This is evident in the ongoing debates surrounding foreign ownership limits and the consistent use of joint-venture (JV) structures where state-owned enterprises (SOEs) retain a majority shareholding. For instance, while new legislation has been proposed to allow foreign entities to hold as much as 80% of mining projects, the flagship mega-projects are structured as JVs where Algerian state entities hold a controlling 51% or 56% stake.   

This structure indicates a clear state strategy: the government de-risks these massive, capital-intensive projects by providing regulatory certainty, undertaking land acquisition, and facilitating access to infrastructure, while leveraging foreign partners for their specialized technical expertise, operational experience, and access to international capital markets. This model ensures that while foreign technology is utilized, ultimate control over these strategic national resources and a majority of the economic benefits remain within Algeria. For potential foreign partners, this presents a specific type of opportunity centered on long-term service and partnership contracts rather than outright asset ownership. Success in this environment requires alignment with Algeria's national development objectives, including commitments to local employment, technology transfer, and the development of downstream processing capabilities.

The Architecture of State Control: Mapping the Key SOEs
The execution of Algeria's mining strategy is managed through a network of powerful state-owned enterprises, each with a specific role in the value chain. Understanding this corporate architecture is critical to navigating the sector.

Groupe SONAREM (Société Nationale de Recherches et d'Exploitation Minières): The historic national mining company, SONAREM remains a pivotal entity. It is a key stakeholder in the Gara Djebilet project and is leading the initiative to reopen the Amesmessa and Tirek gold mines. It also functions as a parent company for several specialized subsidiaries.   

Manadjim El Djazair (Manal SpA): Formed in 2011, Manal is a major industrial mining group tasked with managing and developing a diverse portfolio of national mining assets. It holds the state's majority interest in the Ouenza and Boukhdra iron ore mines and is a key partner in the ACFC phosphate joint venture. Its mandate covers a wide range of minerals, including phosphate, gold, zinc, lead, and various industrial minerals.   

Below these holding companies are several specialized, commodity-focused subsidiaries that serve as the primary operators and JV partners for most of the country's mining assets:

FERAAL (Société Nationale du Fer et de l'Acier): The designated state champion for the development and operation of the Gara Djebilet iron ore mega-project.   

SOMIFER (Societe des Mines de Fer d'Algerie): A subsidiary of Groupe SONAREM, SOMIFER operates a portfolio of established iron ore mines in eastern Algeria, including Anini, Rouina, and Khanguet.   

ENOF (Entreprise Nationale des Produits Miniers Non Ferreux et des Substances Utiles): A key player in the non-ferrous and industrial minerals sector. ENOF was the former operator of the Ismail mercury mine and is the state partner in the Tala Hamza zinc-lead JV. It also operates a significant number of baryte, feldspar, and aggregate facilities across the country.   

Asmidal and SOMIPHOS: These state-owned entities are focused on the phosphate value chain, from mining (SOMIPHOS) to fertilizer production (Asmidal), and are the primary Algerian partners in the integrated phosphate projects.   

The Iron and Steel Value Chain: From Gara Djebilet to Global Markets
Algeria's ambition to become a major steel producer is anchored by the Gara Djebilet project, a transformative initiative designed to leverage the nation's largest mineral deposit. This project, combined with the modernization of existing mines and downstream facilities, aims to achieve self-sufficiency in steel production and establish Algeria as a significant exporter to regional and European markets.

The Gara Djebilet Mega-Project: Unlocking the Sahara's Iron Heart
The Gara Djebilet mine, located in the remote Tindouf province near the Mauritanian border, is one of the world's largest undeveloped iron ore deposits, with estimated resources of over 3.5 billion tonnes. The ore body is sedimentary in nature, with the upper layers composed mainly of hematite and the main body consisting of magnetite and maghemite, making it suitable for large-scale, low-cost open-pit mining operations.   

Despite the deposit's immense scale, its development faces a critical technical challenge: a naturally high phosphorus content of approximately 0.8%. For the production of high-quality steel, this must be reduced to a maximum of 0.1% through a complex and energy-intensive dephosphorization process. The economic and technical success of this beneficiation step is the single most important variable for the project's overall viability.   

The project is being developed by the state-owned FERAAL in a strategic partnership with a Chinese consortium (CMH). Under the agreement, FERAAL is responsible for the mining operations, while the Chinese partner is tasked with constructing the necessary processing units. The development is phased, with an initial production target of 2-3 million tonnes per year (Mt/y) by 2026, followed by a dramatic ramp-up to between 40 and 50 Mt/y by 2040.   

The project's design embodies the national strategy of integrated, in-country value addition. A series of primary ore processing units with a total capacity of 40 Mt/y are planned for the mine site in Tindouf. The ore will then be transported via a new, purpose-built railway line to the Bechar region for further processing. In Bechar, a new steel complex is under construction in the Toumiate industrial zone, where FERAAL and its Turkish partner Tosyali, with construction work entrusted to the Chinese group Sinosteel, will build iron ore concentrate and pellet plants. The first phase of this complex is scheduled to come online in July 2026, with a capacity to process 2 million tonnes of ore to produce 1 million tonnes of concentrate.   

The Eastern Mines: The Traditional Heartbeat of Algerian Iron
While Gara Djebilet represents the future, Algeria's existing iron ore production is centered in the east of the country, primarily in Tébessa Province. These mines have long been the primary source of raw material for the nation's domestic steel industry.

MFE Ouenza Mine: Historically Algeria's largest surface mine, the Ouenza open-pit operation produced approximately 1.62 million tonnes of run-of-mine (ROM) ore in 2021. The mine is operated by Société des Mines de Fer de l'Est (MFE), a company majority-owned by the state holding group Manal SpA (79%) with the state steelmaker SIDER El Hadjar SpA (21%) holding the remainder. In recent years, the mine has faced a decline in production due to challenges related to the quality management of its low-grade hematite and goethite ores.   

MFE Boukhdra Mine: Located approximately 20 km south of Ouenza, the Boukhdra mine shares a similar geology and is also operated by MFE. An open-pit operation active since 1926, its ore body is known to contain other minerals, including baryte, galena, and sphalerite, alongside the primary iron carbonates and oxides.   

SOMIFER Mines: The state-owned Societe des Mines de Fer d'Algerie (SOMIFER), a 100% subsidiary of Groupe SONAREM, operates a portfolio of smaller iron ore mines that supplement the national supply. These include the Anini Mine (Sétif province), the Rouina Mine (Ain Defla province), and the Khanguet and Chaabet el Ballout mines (Tébessa and Souk Ahras provinces, respectively). These operations are significantly smaller in scale than Ouenza, with design capacities ranging from 50,000 to 170,000 tonnes per annum.   

Downstream Integration: Algeria's Steel Manufacturing Capabilities
The ultimate goal of Algeria's iron ore strategy is to feed a robust and modern domestic steel industry. The country's downstream capacity is currently a mix of legacy state-owned facilities and modern private/joint-venture plants.

El-Hadjar Steel Complex (Annaba): This large, integrated steelworks, located near the port of Annaba, has been the backbone of Algeria's steel industry since the early 1970s. Operated by the state-owned Sider El Hadjar SpA, it is the primary customer for ore from the Ouenza and Boukhdra mines. The complex utilizes a traditional production route with blast furnaces (BF) and basic oxygen furnaces (BOF), and also has electric arc furnace (EAF) capacity.   

Tosyali Algérie Steel Complex (Bethioua, Oran): Representing the new generation of Algerian steelmaking, this is a massive, modern complex operated by the Turkish industrial group Tosyali Holding. The facility is a key partner in the Gara Djebilet value chain and is equipped with advanced processing technology, including a 4 Mt/y iron ore beneficiation plant, a 4 Mt/y pelletizing unit, and the world's largest single-module direct reduction iron (DRI) plant. The DRI plant feeds hot-briquetted iron directly to an adjacent EAF melt shop, a highly efficient and modern steelmaking process.   

The development of Gara Djebilet and its associated infrastructure signifies a fundamental reorientation of Algeria's industrial geography. For over a century, the country's iron and steel sector has been anchored in the east, centered around the mature mines of Tébessa and the El-Hadjar complex in Annaba. The Gara Djebilet project creates a new, powerful economic axis in the west, stretching from the Saharan mines of Tindouf, through the processing hubs of Bechar, to the advanced steelmaking facilities in Oran. This shift from east to west, from legacy assets to greenfield mega-projects, will require unprecedented investment in logistics, particularly the new 900-km railway, and will rebalance the country's industrial landscape. While creating immense opportunity in the west, it also raises strategic questions about the long-term role and viability of the older eastern mines and the El-Hadjar complex, which will likely require significant modernization to remain competitive in this new domestic environment.

The Integrated Phosphate Projects: Building a Global Fertilizer Hub
In parallel with its iron ore ambitions, Algeria is executing an equally transformative mega-project strategy for its phosphate resources. By combining some of the world's largest phosphate deposits with its abundant and low-cost natural gas, the country is positioning itself to become a vertically integrated, globally significant producer and exporter of phosphate fertilizers. This initiative is central to the government's economic diversification goals and its strategy to enhance both national and regional food security.

The Bled El Hadba Mine: A World-Class Phosphate Resource
The centerpiece of the integrated phosphate project is the Bled El Hadba mine, located in the Tébessa province of northeastern Algeria. This is a world-class deposit, with recoverable reserves estimated to be between 800 million and 2.2 billion tonnes of phosphate ore, placing Algeria among the top global holders of phosphate resources.   

Development of this vast resource is being managed by the Algerian-Chinese Fertilizers Company (ACFC), a joint venture established in March 2022. The ownership structure reflects the state's majority control, with Algerian state-owned companies Asmidal (a fertilizer producer) and Manal (a mining group) holding a combined 56% stake, while Chinese partners Wuhuan Engineering and Yunnan TIAN'AN Chemical hold the remaining 44%. The total investment for the integrated project is approximately $7 billion. The official inauguration of the project took place in November 2024, with initial production from the mine and associated facilities scheduled to commence in early 2027.   

The Djebel Onk Mining Complex
Complementing the new development at Bled El Hadba is the historic Djebel Onk mining complex, also located in Tébessa province near the Tunisian border. This complex has been a center of Algerian phosphate production since 1965 and sits on a deposit with estimated reserves of 2.8 billion tonnes. The site includes an existing ore washing plant that processes approximately 10,000 tons per day.   

A significant challenge and opportunity at Djebel Onk is the management of historical and ongoing waste streams. The beneficiation process generates over 4,000 tons of phosphate sludge per day, which is rich in recoverable phosphate (around 20% P 
2
​
 O

​
 ) but also contains heavy metals, posing both an environmental liability and a potential secondary resource. To support a massive expansion of production from the entire Tébessa phosphate basin, a new mining railway line is under construction to connect the Djebel Onk area with the Mediterranean port of Annaba. This line is designed to transport over 23 million tonnes of phosphate annually, signaling the scale of Algeria's production ambitions.   

Downstream Integration: From Phosphate Rock to Finished Fertilizers
The strategic core of the integrated phosphate project lies in its extensive downstream processing capabilities, designed to convert raw phosphate rock into high-value finished fertilizers for domestic use and export. The plan involves the construction of a major phosphate fertilizer production and processing complex in Oued Kebrit (Souk Ahras), along with up to 21 additional processing units spread across the industrial hubs of Souk Ahras, Annaba, and Skikda.   

This industrial ecosystem will be fed with enriched phosphate from the Bled El Hadba and Djebel Onk mines and will produce a range of fertilizer products, including phosphoric acid, ammonia, and ammonium-based fertilizers. The project is a clear manifestation of the state's strategy to create powerful synergies between its two greatest natural endowments: minerals and hydrocarbons. The production of nitrogen-based fertilizers, such as urea and diammonium phosphate (DAP), relies on the Haber-Bosch process to synthesize ammonia (NH 
3
​
 ). This process uses natural gas (methane, CH 
4
​
 ) as both a primary feedstock and an energy source. As one of the world's leading producers of natural gas, Algeria has a significant competitive advantage in the form of a secure and low-cost domestic supply. By vertically integrating its massive phosphate rock reserves (the "P" in NPK fertilizers) with its cheap natural gas (to produce the nitrogen or "N" component), Algeria is building a highly competitive, fully domestic value chain for a complete suite of essential agricultural nutrients. This transforms a basic mining operation into a sophisticated chemical and manufacturing industry, positioning Algeria to become a dominant force in the global fertilizer market.   

Base Metals, Precious Metals, and Strategic Minerals
Beyond the mega-projects in iron and phosphate, Algeria's economic diversification strategy includes the development of significant deposits of base metals, precious metals, and other strategic minerals. These projects, while smaller in scale than Gara Djebilet or Bled El Hadba, are crucial for broadening the country's industrial base and export portfolio.

Lead and Zinc: The Tala Hamza (Oued Amizour) Project
The Tala Hamza zinc-lead project, often referred to by its location in Oued Amizour, is a world-class base metals deposit situated just 15 km from the Mediterranean port city of Bejaïa. Its strategic location provides excellent access to established infrastructure, including an international airport, a deep-water port, grid power, and abundant water, as well as close proximity to European zinc smelters, which are key target markets.   

The deposit holds a substantial mineral resource of 68.6 million tonnes with an average grade of 4.6% zinc and 1.2% lead, sufficient to support a mine life of over 20 years. Upon reaching full production, it has the potential to rank among the top ten largest zinc mines globally.   

The project is operated by Western Mediterranean Zinc (WMZ), an Algerian-Australian joint venture. The ownership structure aligns with the national strategy of state control, with Australian miner Terramin holding a 49% stake while a consortium of Algerian state entities holds the majority 51% (comprising ENOF at 48.5% and the national geological survey ORGM at 2.5%).   

After years of studies and administrative delays, the project achieved a critical milestone in May 2023 with the issuance of the final mining permit by the Algerian regulator. This permit allows for an expanded mining and processing rate of 2.0 Mt/y of ore, an increase from the 1.3 Mt/y envisioned in the 2018 definitive feasibility study. Construction is now underway, with an Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contract awarded to China's Sinosteel. The project includes the construction of a processing plant (concentrator) on-site to produce zinc and lead concentrates for export, with full production targeted to commence in 2026. The historic El Abed mine near Tlemcen, formerly a major source of zinc and lead, is now the site of the École des Mines d'El Abed, a public school for mining professions, indicating a shift from production to human resource development at that specific location.   

Gold: Revitalizing the Saharan Mines
Algeria possesses significant gold reserves, primarily located in the remote Hoggar region of the deep south. The country's two largest gold mines, Amesmessa and Tirek, are part of the same mining complex in Tamanrasset province. After being dormant since 2013, the state-owned mining group Sonarem announced plans to relaunch operations, targeting a restart in 2026.   

The combined deposits hold estimated reserves of 60 to 70 tonnes of gold. The revitalization project is not limited to restarting primary extraction. It also includes plans to process old mining waste and tailings, which remain rich in gold, using modern secondary extraction techniques as part of a circular economy approach. The Amesmessa-Tirek complex historically used both heap leach and carbon-in-leach (CIL)/carbon-in-column (CIC) processing circuits, with a final Adsorption, Desorption, and Recovery (ADR) plant to produce doré bars. Algeria also possesses domestic gold refining capabilities through the state-owned company AGENOR, which operates a refinery in Algiers utilizing the Minataur™ technology developed by South Africa's Mintek.   

In a parallel effort to formalize the sector and combat illegal mining, Sonarem plans to establish dedicated processing centers in the key artisanal mining hubs of In Guezzam, Tamanrasset, and Djanet to purchase and process ore from small-scale miners.   

Other Strategic and Historical Assets
Algeria's geology hosts a variety of other mineral resources, some with a history of production and others representing future potential.

Mercury: The Ismail Mine, part of the Azzaba mercurial complex, was a significant mercury producer for over three decades. Operated by ENOF, production peaked in the 1970s but ceased in the early 2000s due to persistent flooding from an underground river and growing environmental concerns. The complex was officially closed in May 2006 and now represents a legacy environmental site.   

Uranium: Extensive exploration, primarily conducted in the 1970s, confirmed that Algeria possesses reasonably assured conventional uranium resources of approximately 26,000 tonnes of uranium (tU). Several vein-type deposits were delineated in the Precambrian basement rocks of the Hoggar region, including Tahaggart, Timgaouine, and Abankor. These resources remain undeveloped but are considered a long-term strategic asset for the country.   

Manganese: Known manganese deposits exist, most notably at Djebel Guettara in the Ougarta mountain range (Béchar province), which holds an estimated 3 million tonnes of ore with a grade of 47.2% Mn. The development of a new manganese mine in the Béchar region is part of the government's current slate of new mining projects.   

Copper: The historical record indicates several copper mining sites. The Ain Barbar mine in northeastern Algeria is described as a historic polymetallic deposit with copper, lead, and zinc veins. However, more recent reports also classify it as a major feldspar deposit operated by ENOF's subsidiary, Sofeld, suggesting a complex or evolving operational history. The Bou Soufa mine is also noted as a copper deposit located in the El Aouana volcanic massif.   

Industrial Minerals: The Bedrock of Domestic Industry
While mega-projects in metals and phosphates capture international attention, Algeria's industrial minerals sector forms the essential bedrock of its domestic economy. This sector provides critical raw materials for construction, manufacturing, and, most importantly, the country's vital oil and gas industry.

The Baryte Sector: Fueling the Oil and Gas Industry
Baryte (barium sulfate, BaSO 
4
​
 ) is arguably Algeria's most strategic industrial mineral due to its indispensable role as a weighting agent in drilling muds used for oil and gas exploration and production. Given the hydrocarbon sector's dominance in the national economy, a secure domestic supply of baryte is a crucial component of the country's industrial supply chain. Algeria's baryte mining potential is estimated at 6.7 million tonnes.   

The country's most significant baryte deposits and operations are located in the northern Tell Atlas region and are primarily operated by the state-owned company ENOF and its subsidiaries.

Ain Mimoun ("Mizab") Deposit (Khenchela): This is a major operating mine consisting of a complex field of baryte veins covering an area of around 250 km². The deposit is operated by ENOF and includes an associated processing plant that utilizes gravimetric separation methods (jigging) to produce a concentrate suitable for the oil drilling sector. The plant has a production capacity of 40,000 tonnes per year.   

Boukaïd Deposit (Tissemsilt): Located in the Ouarsenis Mountains region, Boukaïd is another of Algeria's primary baryte production centers. The site is operated by ENOF (historically through its subsidiary Somibar) and includes both underground mining operations and a processing plant. The plant is designed to enrich the raw ore through crushing, gravimetric separation, and pulverization to meet the strict specifications of the American Petroleum Institute (API) for drilling-grade baryte.   

Other Deposits and Historical Mines: Several other baryte deposits of economic interest have been identified, including Mellal (Tlemcen) and Koudiat Safia (Medea). A significant deposit is also noted near Bechar at Draissa, which has a treatment plant with a capacity of 100,000 tonnes per year. The initial list provided for this report included numerous other named baryte mines, such as St. Paul, Affensou, Mekla, Rivet, Keddara, Bou Zega, and Palestro. While some of these, like Keddara, are confirmed historical mining sites, public information on their current operational status is limited, suggesting they are likely either inactive, exhausted, or very small-scale operations.   

Other Significant Industrial Minerals
Beyond baryte, Algeria produces a wide range of industrial minerals to support its construction and manufacturing sectors. Many of these operations are managed by specialized subsidiaries of the state-owned groups.

Feldspar: The Ain Barbar mine in Annaba province is identified as one of the country's largest feldspar reserves, with an estimated 7 million tonnes of ore. The operating entity was Sofeld (Societe des Feldspaths d'Algerie), a subsidiary of ENOF. This designation conflicts with historical records identifying Ain Barbar as a polymetallic mine with zinc, copper, and lead veins, suggesting either a change in commodity focus over time or the presence of multiple mineral types within the same deposit.   

Salt: The national salt producer is ENASEL (Entreprise Nationale des Sels), which manages the country's salt production facilities.   

Marble: Marble quarrying and processing are handled by ENAMARBRE (Entreprise Nationale du Marbre), with large reserves noted at Djebel Filfila near Skikda.   

Aggregates, Sand, and Kaolin: A vast number of quarries for construction materials are active across the country. The state-owned ENG (Entreprise Nationale des Granulats) is a major producer of aggregates. ENOF also operates numerous units producing aggregates and sands in provinces such as Boumerdes, Oran, and Skikda. Sizable kaolin deposits are also worked at Djebel Debar.

Concluding Analysis and Forward Outlook
Synthesis of Key Findings
The analysis of Algeria's mining and mineral processing sector reveals a two-tiered industry undergoing a profound strategic realignment. The first tier consists of a handful of state-driven, world-scale mega-projects in iron ore, phosphates, and zinc-lead, which are poised to fundamentally transform the country's industrial base and export profile. These projects are characterized by massive capital investment, strategic partnerships with foreign technical experts, and a clear focus on vertical integration to capture the maximum value chain within Algeria. The second tier is a legacy sector of smaller, often older, mines and quarries producing a range of commodities—primarily industrial minerals like baryte and smaller volumes of iron ore—that have historically served the domestic market.

A core principle unifying the new mega-projects is the strategy of leveraging synergies between Algeria's vast mineral and hydrocarbon endowments. The integrated phosphate project, which combines immense phosphate rock reserves with low-cost natural gas to produce a full suite of fertilizers, is the prime example of this model. This approach transforms simple resource extraction into a sophisticated, high-value manufacturing industry, giving Algeria a significant competitive advantage on the global stage.

The primary vehicle for this development is a state-capitalist partnership model. Rather than privatizing its strategic assets, the Algerian state, through its network of SOEs like SONAREM, Manal, and FERAAL, retains majority ownership and control while bringing in foreign partners to provide capital, technology, and operational expertise. This model mitigates risk for foreign investors while ensuring that the projects align with national strategic objectives.

Opportunities and Risks for Stakeholders
This transformative period in Algerian mining presents significant opportunities alongside notable risks for international and domestic stakeholders.

Opportunities:

Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC): The sheer scale of the Gara Djebilet, Bled El Hadba, and Tala Hamza projects creates enormous opportunities for EPC contractors with experience in large-scale mining and processing plant construction, as evidenced by the significant roles played by Chinese firms like CMH and Sinosteel.

Technology and Equipment Providers: The technical challenges of Algeria's key ore bodies—particularly the dephosphorization of Gara Djebilet iron ore and the processing of phosphate sludge at Djebel Onk—create a strong demand for specialized beneficiation technologies, water-efficient processing solutions, and advanced mining equipment.

Infrastructure and Logistics: The development of remote deposits, especially Gara Djebilet, necessitates massive investment in supporting infrastructure, including the construction of new railways, ports, power generation, and water supply systems, opening a major field for infrastructure developers and logistics providers.

Offtake and Trading: The projected output from these projects—up to 50 Mt/y of iron ore and 6 million tonnes of fertilizers—will make Algeria a major new supplier in global commodity markets, creating significant opportunities for offtake agreements and trading partnerships.

Risks:

Project Execution Risk: The immense scale and complexity of the mega-projects carry inherent risks of budget overruns and schedule delays, particularly given their location in remote and challenging environments.

Bureaucratic and Political Risk: Partnering with state-owned entities involves navigating complex bureaucratic processes. The overarching influence of state politics on commercial terms and project timelines remains a key risk factor for foreign investors.

Technical and Geological Risk: The economic success of Gara Djebilet hinges on the cost-effective implementation of dephosphorization technology at scale. Any failure to meet the required ore specifications could severely impact the project's viability.

Commodity Price Volatility: As Algeria becomes a major producer, its economic returns will become increasingly exposed to the volatility of global prices for steel, fertilizers, and zinc.

Forward Outlook: Algeria's Path to Becoming a Diversified Mineral Power
The Algerian government has laid out an ambitious and coherent strategy to transform its mining sector into a primary engine of economic growth. The successful execution of the Gara Djebilet, Bled El Hadba, and Tala Hamza projects by their target dates in 2026-2027 will be the critical test of this strategy. If achieved, these projects will not only generate billions of dollars in new export revenues but will also create tens of thousands of jobs and catalyze the development of new industrial ecosystems and infrastructure corridors, particularly in the country's historically underdeveloped south and west.

By leveraging its unique combination of world-class mineral deposits and low-cost energy, Algeria has a credible pathway to reposition itself as a major non-hydrocarbon industrial power in Africa and the Mediterranean. The success of this transition will depend on the state's ability to maintain policy consistency, effectively manage its complex partnerships with foreign firms, and overcome the significant technical and logistical hurdles ahead. The coming decade will be decisive in determining whether the immense potential locked within Algeria's subsoil can be fully realized.
