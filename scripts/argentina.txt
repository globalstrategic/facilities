The Argentinian Mining & Mineral Processing Landscape: A Comprehensive Asset Compendium and Sector Analysis
Executive Summary
Argentina's mining sector is at a pivotal inflection point, transitioning from a historically significant precious metals producer into a globally strategic supplier of critical minerals for the 21st-century energy transition. This transformation is driven by a dual-engine growth narrative: an explosive, ongoing expansion in lithium production and the imminent revival of a world-class copper sector. The confluence of exceptional geological endowment and a renewed, incentive-driven policy framework has unlocked a project pipeline poised to attract tens of billions of dollars in capital investment and fundamentally reshape the nation's export economy.

The current asset landscape is characterized by a concentration of activity in distinct geological provinces. The Puna region, encompassing the provinces of Jujuy, Salta, and Catamarca, forms Argentina's portion of the "Lithium Triangle" and is the epicenter of the lithium boom. This region hosts multiple brine operations in various stages of production and construction, rapidly scaling the country's output of lithium carbonate. In the south, the Deseado Massif of Santa Cruz province remains the heartland of precious metals production, hosting a cluster of major gold and silver mines operated by global industry leaders. The most significant future potential, however, lies along the Andean cordillera in the provinces of San Juan, Catamarca, and Salta, where a portfolio of giant, undeveloped porphyry copper deposits is now advancing toward development.

The primary catalyst for unlocking this potential, particularly for the capital-intensive copper pipeline, is the national government's Incentive Regime for Large Investments (RIGI). By offering 30-year fiscal and foreign exchange stability, RIGI directly addresses the macroeconomic volatility that has historically deterred the multi-billion-dollar commitments required for mega-projects. The world's largest mining corporations have responded by formally submitting their flagship copper projects for inclusion in the regime, signaling a clear endorsement of the policy as a necessary precondition for development.

This report provides a comprehensive compendium of Argentina's mining and mineral processing facilities, cataloging assets across all stages of the project lifecycle—from active production to advanced feasibility and recent closures. It details a sector comprising at least 20 major producing mines and processing facilities, with another 6 projects in construction and over 15 in advanced feasibility or development stages.

Looking forward, Argentina is on a clear trajectory to become a top-tier global producer of both lithium and copper. The successful ramp-up of new lithium projects, particularly those employing advanced Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) technologies, will be a key determinant of the sector's long-term competitiveness. The synchronized advance of the copper mega-projects toward construction decisions points to a transformative surge in production and export revenue around the turn of the decade. However, significant challenges persist. The realization of this potential is contingent upon sustained political and regulatory stability, the effective navigation of provincial-level environmental and social governance, and a parallel commitment to overcoming critical infrastructure deficits in energy, transport, and water management.

Part I: Macro-Level Sector Analysis
This section provides a strategic overview of the forces shaping Argentina's mining industry. It analyzes the fundamental shift in the country's commodity focus, the evolving regulatory landscape that is catalyzing new investment, and the key geological provinces that host the nation's mineral wealth.

Argentina's Mining Renaissance: From Precious Metals to Critical Minerals
Argentina's mining sector is undergoing a profound strategic pivot. While the nation has a long history as a significant producer of gold and silver, its future economic importance and global market position are now being redefined by its vast endowments of lithium and copper—the foundational materials of the global energy transition. This shift is not merely one of diversification but represents a fundamental realignment of capital, exploration focus, and national industrial strategy in response to powerful global megatrends.   

The economic impact of this transition is already evident in the country's trade balance. Mining exports reached approximately USD 4.5 billion in 2024, a 6% year-over-year increase, with projections indicating a potential surge to over USD 18 billion annually by 2030. This growth is accelerating, with export values for the first nine months of 2025 climbing 32.9% compared to the same period in the previous year, driven primarily by strong performance in the lithium and gold sectors. However, this aggregate growth masks a deeper structural change. Gold output, long the backbone of the industry, has been in a concerning decline, falling 39% from its 2018 peak and projected to decrease by another 10% year-on-year. This trend reflects the maturation and depletion of legacy assets. In stark contrast, the investment and production volumes in lithium are expanding at an exponential rate, clearly indicating where new capital is being deployed. This juxtaposition—declining precious metals output concurrent with a boom in critical minerals investment—demonstrates that Argentina's mining identity is actively shifting from that of a traditional safe-haven metal producer to a strategic supplier for the world's battery and electrification supply chains.   

The lithium boom is the most mature element of this transformation. Situated within the prolific "Lithium Triangle" alongside Bolivia and Chile, Argentina holds the world's third-largest reserves and is currently the fourth-largest producer. The sector has seen a dramatic scaling of its productive capacity, expanding from an installed base of 35,500 tonnes of Lithium Carbonate Equivalent (LCE) per year to 186,000 tonnes annually. This growth is set to continue, with a robust pipeline of 17 new projects that, if developed, could require an additional USD 12.8 billion in investment and elevate the country's total productive capacity to approximately 580,000 tonnes of LCE.   

Following closely behind lithium is the revival of Argentina's copper sector, which represents the next major frontier of growth. The country has been without a large-scale operating copper mine since the closure of the Bajo de la Alumbrera operation in 2018 due to reserve depletion. This production hiatus is set to end dramatically. A pipeline of globally significant copper projects is now advancing through feasibility and permitting, including Josemaría, Los Azules, El Pachón, Taca Taca, and the MARA project. These developments, primarily located in the Andean provinces, are of such a scale that they could collectively add over 1 million tonnes of annual copper production capacity. This would not only restore Argentina's status as a copper producer but elevate it into the ranks of the world's top suppliers, fundamentally altering the global supply landscape.   

The growth trajectories of these two key sectors are structurally distinct. The lithium boom has been characterized by the incremental development of multiple brine operations, with individual project capital expenditures typically in the hundreds of millions of dollars. This has allowed a diverse range of mid-tier companies, specialists, and new entrants to participate. In contrast, the copper revival will be defined by a handful of mega-projects, each requiring capital investment on an entirely different order of magnitude—ranging from over USD 3 billion for Los Azules to a staggering USD 9.5 billion for El Pachón. This scale necessitates financing from the world's largest mining corporations, such as Glencore and BHP, often in partnership with sovereign wealth funds, major industrial consumers, and international finance institutions. Consequently, the development of the copper sector is more dependent on national-level investment policies and will likely proceed in larger, more discrete steps, with each project having a transformative impact on both regional and national economies.   

The Regulatory and Investment Climate: The RIGI Catalyst
The legal and political framework governing Argentina's mining sector is a critical determinant of its ability to attract the substantial capital required for development. A defining feature of this framework is the constitutional principle that provinces own the mineral resources within their borders and, therefore, act as the primary regulators of mining activity. This federalized structure has created a heterogeneous investment landscape across the country. Provinces such as San Juan, Salta, and Catamarca have cultivated "mining-friendly" reputations by establishing stable regulatory processes and actively promoting exploration and development. In stark contrast, other provinces have enacted restrictive legislation that effectively prohibits certain types of mining. The most prominent example is Chubut province, where Law 5001, passed in 2003, bans open-pit mining and the use of cyanide, a policy that has indefinitely stalled the development of the world-class Navidad silver deposit despite its enormous potential. This provincial authority underscores that a successful investment strategy in Argentina requires not only federal support but also careful navigation of local politics and community relations.   

At the national level, the central policy initiative designed to overcome historical barriers to investment is the "Incentive Regime for Large Investments" (RIGI). This framework, a cornerstone of the current administration's economic policy, is engineered to de-risk large-scale, capital-intensive projects by providing a stable and predictable long-term investment environment. The key provisions of RIGI include a 30-year guarantee of fiscal stability (locking in tax rates), customs benefits for the import of capital goods, and, most critically, stabilized foreign exchange regulations that allow companies to retain a significant portion of their export proceeds offshore. This latter point directly addresses one of the most significant historical deterrents for foreign investors in Argentina: capital controls and the risk of being unable to repatriate profits or service foreign-denominated debt.   

The impact of RIGI on the mining sector, particularly for the nascent copper revival, cannot be overstated. It is viewed by major international mining houses as an essential precondition for deploying the billions of dollars in capital expenditure required for these mega-projects. This is evidenced by the swift action of leading companies to enroll their assets in the program. Glencore has submitted applications for both its El Pachón and MARA (Agua Rica) projects, McEwen Copper has secured RIGI approval for Los Azules, and the developers of Taca Taca and Josemaría have also signaled their intent to apply. This demonstrates a clear consensus within the industry that RIGI provides the necessary assurances to move these world-class deposits from the feasibility stage toward construction.   

However, the RIGI framework may inadvertently create a two-tiered investment environment. Its focus on "Large Investments" means that its benefits are primarily accessible to the multi-billion-dollar copper projects and the largest lithium developments. Smaller mining operations, junior explorers, and projects in other mineral sectors may not meet the investment threshold to qualify. These entities must continue to operate within the traditional, more volatile fiscal and regulatory environment, potentially creating a "barbell" effect where capital becomes highly concentrated in a few mega-projects while a wide range of smaller but still economically viable deposits struggle to attract funding.

Despite the optimism generated by RIGI, persistent challenges remain. The country faces significant infrastructure deficits, including a lack of sufficient power generation, transmission capacity, and transportation networks (road and rail) in the remote Andean regions where the largest deposits are located. Furthermore, social and environmental opposition remains a potent force. The legacy of environmental incidents, such as the cyanide spills at the Veladero mine, has fostered public mistrust in some regions, while concerns over water use and the protection of sensitive ecosystems, like the glacier-related issues that plagued the Pascua-Lama project, continue to be major factors in the permitting process. The enduring stalemate over the Navidad project in Chubut serves as a powerful reminder that even with strong federal incentives, provincial laws and local social license are the ultimate gatekeepers to development.   

Geographic Hubs of Mineral Wealth
Argentina's vast mineral potential is not uniformly distributed but is concentrated in three principal geological and geographical regions, each with a distinct metallogenic signature and portfolio of assets.

The Puna Region (Jujuy, Salta, Catamarca)
This high-altitude arid plateau in northwestern Argentina is the nation's nexus for critical minerals, forming the southern corner of the renowned "Lithium Triangle". The region's geology is defined by a series of internally drained basins containing large salt flats, or salares. Over geological time, lithium has leached from surrounding volcanic rocks and concentrated in the subterranean brines beneath these salt flats. This geological setting hosts all of Argentina's current lithium production and the majority of its projects under development. Key producing and developing salares include Salar de Olaroz and Salar de Cauchari in Jujuy province; Salar del Hombre Muerto on the border of Catamarca and Salta provinces; and Salar Centenario-Ratones, Salar del Rincón, and Sal de Vida in Salta and Catamarca. Beyond the dominant brine resources, the broader Pampean Pegmatite Province, which extends into Catamarca and San Luis, also hosts hard-rock lithium potential in the form of spodumene-bearing pegmatites, such as those found at the Reflejos de Mar prospect.   

The Andean Copper Belt (San Juan, Catamarca, Salta)
Stretching along the country's western spine, this region is a segment of the Neogene Metallogenetic Belt, one of the world's most productive and richly endowed copper provinces, which Argentina shares with its neighbors, Chile and Peru. This belt is characterized by the presence of giant porphyry copper deposits, which are large, low-to-medium grade deposits often containing significant by-products of gold, silver, and molybdenum. While historically underexploited compared to the Chilean side of the Andes, Argentina's portion of the belt hosts a portfolio of world-class projects that now form the basis of its copper revival. The province of San Juan is the undisputed center of this wealth, hosting a cluster of massive deposits including Glencore's El Pachón, McEwen Copper's Los Azules, Aldebaran's Altar, and the Vicuña district projects of Josemaría and Filo del Sol. Further north, the belt extends into Salta, home to First Quantum's Taca Taca project, and Catamarca, where Glencore's MARA (Agua Rica) project is located.   

The Deseado Massif (Santa Cruz)
Located in the southern Patagonian region, the Deseado Massif is a 60,000-square-kilometer geological province that stands as Argentina's premier district for precious metals. The geology is dominated by Jurassic-age volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks that host numerous low-sulfidation epithermal vein systems, which are typically rich in gold and silver. This province is home to the majority of the country's large-scale gold and silver mines. Major operating assets include AngloGold Ashanti's Cerro Vanguardia, Newmont's Cerro Negro complex, and the San José mine (a Hochschild/McEwen JV). The region also hosts a number of smaller operations and advanced projects, such as Cerrado Gold's Don Nicolás mine, demonstrating the pervasive mineralization and continued prospectivity of the massif.

Mines & Facilities in Production
This subsection details the assets that form the current productive base of Argentina's mining industry, actively extracting and processing minerals.

Lithium Operations
Salar de Olaroz (Jujuy): A cornerstone of Argentina's lithium sector, the Salar de Olaroz operation has been in production since 2014. It is majority-owned and operated by Arcadium Lithium (66.5% ownership). The facility utilizes conventional brine mining from the salar, followed by concentration in a large system of solar evaporation ponds to produce lithium carbonate. The operation has recently completed a major expansion, with the Stage 2 facility adding a nameplate capacity of 25,000 tonnes per annum (tpa) of lithium carbonate and achieving its first wet concentrate production in mid-2023.   

Salar del Hombre Muerto - Fénix Project (Catamarca): This is Argentina's longest-running lithium operation, with continuous production since 1997. Wholly owned by Arcadium Lithium, the Fénix project is notable for its use of a proprietary Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) technology, which speeds up the conversion process and reduces the operation's land footprint compared to conventional evaporation methods. The operation is in the midst of a significant, multi-phased expansion aimed at dramatically increasing its output. The first phase, expected to be complete in 2024, will raise lithium carbonate capacity from approximately 18,000 tpa to 40,000 tpa, with a long-term goal of reaching 100,000 tpa by the end of the decade.   

Cauchari-Olaroz (Jujuy): This major new project, which commenced production in 2023, is operated by a joint venture consisting of Ganfeng Lithium (46.66%), Lithium Argentina (44.84%), and the provincial state-owned company Jujuy Energía y Minería Sociedad del Estado (JEMSE) (8.5%). The first phase of the project is designed to produce 40,000 tpa of battery-grade lithium carbonate, making it one of the largest new sources of lithium supply globally.   

Centenario-Ratones (Salta): Operated by French mining and metals group Eramet (100% ownership), this project achieved its first production of lithium carbonate in late 2024. The facility is a showcase for advanced DLE technology, developed in-house by Eramet over a decade, which boasts a lithium recovery rate of approximately 90% and recycles over 60% of the water used in its process. The plant is designed to produce 24,000 tpa of LCE at full capacity, positioning Eramet as the first European company to produce lithium at an industrial scale.   

Gold & Silver Operations
Veladero (San Juan): A flagship of Argentina's gold industry, Veladero has been in continuous operation since 2005. It is a 50/50 joint venture between Barrick Gold and Shandong Gold. The mine is a large-scale open-pit, valley-fill heap leach operation located at high altitude in the Andes. In 2024, the mine produced 504,000 ounces of gold (100% basis), with a forecast for 2025 of between 380,000 and 440,000 ounces. The joint venture is currently executing a USD 400 million investment plan to develop new mining phases and expand processing capacity, aiming to extend the mine's operational life beyond 2033.   

Cerro Negro (Santa Cruz): Owned and operated by Newmont, Cerro Negro is a key asset in the precious metal-rich Deseado Massif. It is not a single mine but a complex of multiple high-grade underground mines—including Eureka, Mariana Central, Mariana Norte, Emilia, and the developing San Marcos—that feed a central processing facility. The operation is currently undergoing a USD 540 million expansion project to extend its mine life to 2034 and increase production to over 350,000 ounces of gold per year. Production was temporarily suspended in April-May 2024 following a fatal accident, but has since resumed.   

Cerro Vanguardia (Santa Cruz): Operating since 1998, Cerro Vanguardia is a mature and consistent producer, majority-owned by AngloGold Ashanti (92.5%) in partnership with the provincial company Fomicruz (7.5%). The operation is complex, involving multiple small open pits with high stripping ratios and several narrow-vein underground mines. Ore is processed through a metallurgical plant with a capacity of 3,500 tonnes per day (tpd) as well as a separate heap leach circuit. In 2024, Cerro Vanguardia produced 175,000 ounces of gold and 3.4 million ounces of silver.   

San José (Santa Cruz): A high-grade underground silver and gold mine that has been in production since 2007. It is operated by Hochschild Mining (51% interest) in a joint venture with McEwen Mining (49%). The processing method involves grinding and flotation, which yields both doré bars and a saleable concentrate. For 2024, total production (100% basis) was 74,000 ounces of gold and 4.2 million ounces of silver.   

Gualcamayo (San Juan): Acquired by Aisa Group's Minas Argentinas S.A. in 2023, the Gualcamayo mine's primary open-pit and underground operations have been placed on care and maintenance. Current production is limited to secondary recovery from existing heap leach pads, which involves re-washing previously stacked ore to extract residual gold. This process yields approximately 50,000 to 55,000 ounces of gold annually. The operator's main focus is on advancing the large-scale Deep Carbonates Project (DCP) to develop a new underground mine beneath the existing workings.   

Lindero (Salta): Operated by Fortuna Silver Mines, Lindero is an open-pit, heap leach gold mine that has established itself as a steady producer in Salta province. In the third quarter of 2025, the mine produced 24,417 ounces of gold, demonstrating consistent performance. The operation is also incorporating sustainable energy sources, with plans approved for the construction of a photovoltaic plant to supply a portion of its power needs.   

Don Nicolás (Santa Cruz): Wholly owned by Cerrado Gold, the Minera Don Nicolás (MDN) operation is undergoing a strategic transition. Having largely depleted the initial open-pit resources from the Paloma and Martinetas deposits that fed its Carbon-in-Leach (CIL) plant, the operation commissioned a new heap leach plant in 2023 to process lower-grade ore from the Calandrias Sur deposit. Furthermore, MDN commenced underground mining in mid-2025, with initial high-grade ore now being blended with stockpiles to feed the mill.   

Manantial Espejo (Santa Cruz): This silver-gold mine, owned by Pan American Silver, was a significant producer in the Deseado Massif, having been inaugurated in 2009. However, its current status is ambiguous. The operation was temporarily suspended in March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. More recent corporate disclosures from Pan American Silver, such as its June 2024 mineral reserves report, do not include Manantial Espejo among its active Silver Segment assets, suggesting the mine is either on long-term care and maintenance, has been depleted, or was divested.   

Base Metals & Industrial Minerals Operations
Puna Operations (Jujuy): This integrated operation, wholly owned by SSR Mining, consists of two main components: the active Chinchillas Mine and the Pirquitas Processing Facility. Chinchillas is an open-pit silver-lead-zinc mine from which ore is transported 40 kilometers by truck to the Pirquitas plant. The original Pirquitas mine, which previously fed the plant, ceased open-pit mining activities in January 2017 and is now in a reclamation and closure phase, with its pit hosting the operation's tailings facility. The Pirquitas processing plant produces a silver-lead concentrate and a zinc concentrate, which are shipped to international smelters for final refining. An addendum to the environmental impact report is currently under evaluation to potentially extend the life of the Puna Operations by an additional two to four years.   

Acindar Steel Plants (Multiple Provinces): Owned by global steel giant ArcelorMittal, Acindar is Argentina's leading producer of non-flat steel products. Its principal facility is the integrated steel mill in Villa Constitución, Santa Fe, which uses a Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) and Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) process. The company also operates ancillary plants in Rosario and San Nicolás (Santa Fe), La Tablada (Buenos Aires), and Villa Mercedes (San Luis). The Villa Constitución plant has a crude steel capacity of 2 million tonnes per annum. However, the company has faced significant challenges due to a sharp decline in domestic industrial and construction activity, leading it to operate at approximately 50% capacity and implement temporary production halts in 2024 and 2025.   

Farallón Negro (Catamarca): Operated by Yacimientos Mineros de Agua de Dionisio (YMAD), an intergovernmental entity, Farallón Negro is an active underground mine producing gold, silver, and manganese. The operation is currently in a modernization phase, with recent public tenders issued for the acquisition of new equipment, including a rock breaker and the execution of ventilation shafts using the raise boring method, to improve efficiency and safety.   

Aguilar Mine (Jujuy): Historically one of Argentina's most significant base metal mines, producing silver, zinc, and lead. It is listed as an operating mine under the ownership of Glencore. However, recent detailed information on its production levels and operational status is not available in the provided documentation, indicating a need for further verification.   

Projects in Construction & Development
This subsection covers projects that have moved beyond the study phases and are actively engaged in construction, with a clear path to becoming producing assets.

Mariana (Salta): A major lithium brine project owned by global lithium producer Ganfeng Lithium, the Mariana project is currently in the construction phase. With a planned investment of USD 1.1 billion, it is set to become a significant contributor to Argentina's lithium output upon completion.   

Sal de Vida (Catamarca): Wholly owned by Arcadium Lithium, Sal de Vida is a high-quality lithium brine project currently in the development stage. Its strategic location within 10 kilometers of Arcadium's long-operating Fénix project at the Salar del Hombre Muerto provides significant potential for operational synergies, shared infrastructure, and technical expertise, positioning it as a highly competitive future operation.   

Hombre Muerto West (Catamarca): Operated by Galan Lithium, this project is in the construction phase following positive feasibility studies. The project involves a planned investment of USD 429 million and is located in the prolific Hombre Muerto salar, adjacent to operations run by major producers.   

Josemaría (San Juan): One of the flagship projects of Argentina's copper revival, Josemaría is in the pre-construction and advanced development phase. The project is being advanced by Vicuña Corporation, a 50/50 joint venture formed by mining giants BHP and Lundin Mining. With a projected capital expenditure of USD 4 to 5 billion, Josemaría is a massive copper-gold-silver deposit. The company is targeting a production start date of 2030, pending final approvals and the completion of detailed engineering.   

Calcatreu (Río Negro): Owned by Patagonia Gold, this gold-silver project has successfully transitioned into the construction phase. After acquiring the project from Pan American Silver in 2018, Patagonia Gold received the final provincial permits for construction in November 2024 and commenced early works, such as road building, in early 2025. The project will utilize heap leach processing, a cost-effective method for the deposit's geology, and is targeting its first gold production in 2026.   

The Next Frontier: Advanced Exploration & Feasibility Pipeline
This subsection outlines the portfolio of projects that have established significant mineral resources and are undergoing advanced technical and economic studies (Preliminary Economic Assessments, Pre-Feasibility, or Feasibility Studies) to determine their viability for development. This pipeline represents the next generation of Argentina's mining assets.

Copper Mega-Projects
Los Azules (San Juan): Arguably the most advanced of the copper mega-projects, Los Azules is owned by McEwen Copper, a subsidiary of McEwen Inc. with strategic partners including automaker Stellantis and Rio Tinto's technology venture, Nuton. An independent Feasibility Study (FS) was completed in October 2025, confirming the project's robust economics with an initial capital cost of USD 3.17 billion. The project has been approved for inclusion in the RIGI framework, providing critical fiscal stability. A key strategic feature is its plan to use a Leach and Solvent Extraction-Electrowinning (SX/EW) process to produce high-purity (99.99%) copper cathodes directly on-site, eliminating the need for an external smelter. The project is targeting a construction start in 2026, with first copper production slated for 2030.   

El Pachón (San Juan): A giant porphyry copper-molybdenum deposit wholly owned by Glencore, El Pachón is in the feasibility stage. The project represents one of the largest undeveloped copper resources in the world. Glencore has formally submitted the project for inclusion in the RIGI program, citing a required capital investment of approximately USD 9.5 billion. Its development would make it one of the largest single mining investments in the country's history.   

MARA (Agua Rica) (Catamarca): Also 100% owned by Glencore, the MARA project is a large copper-gold-molybdenum deposit in the feasibility stage. A key strategic advantage of MARA is its brownfield nature; the project is designed to utilize the existing processing plant and infrastructure of the now-closed Bajo de la Alumbrera mine, which is expected to significantly reduce its capital intensity compared to a greenfield development. Glencore has also submitted MARA for RIGI benefits, with an estimated capital investment of USD 4.0 billion.   

Taca Taca (Salta): A large copper-gold-molybdenum project wholly owned by First Quantum Minerals, Taca Taca is in the advanced development stage. The company submitted its initial Environmental and Social Impact Assessment in 2019 and is awaiting final approval, with a formal development decision anticipated in 2024. The project envisions a large-scale open-pit mine with a 60 million tonnes per annum processing plant.   

Altar (San Juan): A very large, district-scale cluster of copper-gold porphyry deposits being advanced by Aldebaran Resources (80% interest) in a joint venture with Sibanye-Stillwater (20%). The project is progressing towards a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA), which has been delayed to the third quarter of 2025 to allow for the evaluation of multiple development scenarios, including the potential use of Nuton leaching technology.   

Filo del Sol (San Juan): Part of the Vicuña district portfolio held by the BHP and Lundin Mining joint venture, Filo del Sol is a significant copper-gold-silver discovery in the advanced exploration and pre-feasibility stage. Its development is planned to be integrated with the nearby Josemaría project, leveraging shared infrastructure and creating a major mining hub in the region.   

Other Key Projects
Diablillos (Salta): A high-grade, advanced-stage silver-gold project wholly owned by AbraSilver Resource. The company completed an updated Preliminary Feasibility Study (PFS) in December 2024 and is actively advancing the project toward a full feasibility study. Recent exploration drilling has continued to expand the known resource, highlighting significant upside potential.   

Gualcamayo Deep Carbonates Project (DCP) (San Juan): This is a brownfield expansion project at the existing Gualcamayo mine, owned by Minas Argentinas S.A.. The project aims to develop a new underground mine to exploit a large sulfide gold deposit situated beneath the depleted oxide resources. A feasibility study is currently underway and is expected to be completed in 2025, with the project potentially extending the productive life of Gualcamayo by over 17 years.   

Amarillo Grande (Río Negro): A district-scale uranium-vanadium project owned by Blue Sky Uranium, Amarillo Grande is in the advanced exploration stage and is progressing towards a prefeasibility study. The project hosts the Ivana deposit, for which a PEA was completed in early 2024, making it one of Argentina's most advanced uranium projects.   

Joaquín (Santa Cruz): An advanced exploration silver-gold project owned by Unico Silver. The project recently announced a significant new discovery at the La Morocha SE zone. While some high-grade, small-scale mining was recently completed, the broader project has been placed on care and maintenance as the company focuses on resource expansion ahead of a revised Mineral Resource Estimate.   

Dormant, Suspended, and Historical Assets
This subsection covers significant assets that are not currently in production due to legal prohibitions, economic factors, or because they have reached the end of their operational life.

Pascua-Lama (San Juan): A large, high-profile, and complex case, this cross-border gold-silver project, owned by Barrick Gold, was officially suspended in 2013 due to environmental issues, legal challenges, and cost overruns. The Chilean portion of the project, Pascua, is now undergoing a definitive closure process as ordered by Chilean environmental authorities. However, the Argentine portion, Lama, which holds significant resources, is being re-evaluated by Barrick as a potential standalone underground mining operation. This revised concept could potentially see Lama's ore processed through an integrated complex with the nearby, operational Veladero mine.   

Bajo de la Alumbrera (Catamarca): Once Argentina's flagship copper-gold mine, open-pit mining operations ceased in 2018 upon the depletion of its economic reserves. The site, co-owned by Glencore and Newmont, is now in an advanced stage of closure, with extensive reclamation and revegetation programs underway. The enduring legacy of Alumbrera is its substantial processing and transport infrastructure, which is now the central enabling asset for Glencore's MARA project, transforming it from a greenfield challenge into a more viable brownfield development.   

Navidad (Chubut): Owned by Pan American Silver, Navidad is one of the world's largest undeveloped primary silver deposits. The project is currently on care and maintenance and is effectively stranded due to Provincial Law 5001 in Chubut, which prohibits open-pit mining and the use of cyanide—the methods deemed necessary for the project's economic extraction. Despite ongoing dialogue and past legislative attempts to create mining-permissive zones, the law remains in place, leaving the project in a state of indefinite suspension.   

El Quevar (Salta): This advanced-stage silver exploration project was part of the portfolio of Golden Minerals Company. In a strategic move to divest non-core assets and address liquidity concerns, Golden Minerals completed the sale of the El Quevar project to Argenta Silver Corp. (formerly Butte Energy Inc.) in October 2024.   

Lomada de Leiva (Santa Cruz): A former open-pit, heap leach gold mine operated by Patagonia Gold, primary mining operations at Lomada de Leiva ceased in November 2017. However, the site continues to generate a small amount of production through residual leaching of the existing pads. The site's infrastructure remains valuable and may be utilized to support the development of other nearby projects in Patagonia Gold's portfolio, such as Cap-Oeste.   

Part III: Strategic Insights and Forward Outlook
This final section synthesizes the asset-level data into a forward-looking analysis of Argentina's mining sector. It examines the country's capabilities in downstream processing, profiles the key corporate actors driving development, and provides a strategic outlook on the industry's trajectory through 2035.

Processing, Refining, and Value Addition: From Concentrate to Cathode
An analysis of Argentina's mineral processing landscape reveals a clear and dominant operational model: the production of mineral concentrates for export to international markets. This is the standard practice for the country's base metal operations. The Puna Operations in Jujuy, for example, produce silver-lead and zinc concentrates that are explicitly "shipped to international smelters" for final refining. Similarly, the majority of the forthcoming copper projects, such as San Jorge, are being designed as concentrate-producing operations. This model positions Argentina as a significant upstream supplier of raw materials but captures only a fraction of the final value of the refined metal.   

There are, however, important exceptions that demonstrate existing and emerging capabilities for domestic value addition. In the precious metals sector, major gold and silver mines like Cerro Vanguardia and San José operate on-site facilities to produce doré bars—a semi-pure alloy of gold and silver—which is a step beyond simple concentrate and commands a higher value before being sent to international refineries for final purification. The most prominent example of full vertical integration is in the industrial sector. The ArcelorMittal Acindar steelworks in Villa Constitución is an integrated mill that processes iron ore through DRI and EAF technologies to produce a wide range of finished long steel products for both domestic consumption and export. In the lithium sector, all current operations process raw brine into a finished chemical product, either battery-grade lithium carbonate (LCE) or lithium chloride, directly at their facilities in the Puna region. Some of this product, however, is then exported for further conversion into other high-value compounds like lithium hydroxide at specialized plants located abroad.   

The most significant strategic development in this landscape is the technological approach being taken by the Los Azules copper project. Its design incorporates a Leach and Solvent Extraction-Electrowinning (SX/EW) process, which will allow it to produce 99.99% pure LME Grade A copper cathodes on-site. This represents a crucial leap up the value chain, enabling Argentina to export a finished, high-purity metal product instead of an intermediate concentrate.   

The current infrastructure for primary metal refining remains a critical gap. The available information does not identify any large-scale primary smelters for non-ferrous metals like copper, lead, or zinc currently operating in the country. While there is an aluminum smelter (Aluar) and secondary lead recycling plants, the lack of primary smelting capacity for base metals means that the vast output from the future copper mines (with the exception of Los Azules) will have to be exported as concentrate. This dependency on global smelting capacity represents a significant strategic vulnerability and a missed economic opportunity. It exposes Argentine producers to international smelting fees and transport costs, and it forfeits the substantial value uplift and potential for downstream industrial development that a domestic smelting industry could provide.   

The technological choice made for the Los Azules project is therefore not merely a technical one but a strategic masterstroke. By opting for SX/EW, the project developers have ingeniously bypassed the country's primary infrastructure deficit. This approach offers multiple advantages. Economically, it captures a higher margin by selling a finished product and avoids the logistics and costs of shipping massive tonnages of concentrate. Environmentally and socially, it aligns perfectly with the growing market demand for "green copper". The SX/EW process is inherently less water-intensive than traditional milling and concentration, and the project's design includes powering the facility with 100% renewable energy and eliminating the need for a conventional tailings dam. This ESG-friendly profile makes the project more attractive to offtakers and financiers with sustainability mandates, such as the automaker Stellantis, which is a key equity partner in the project. The Los Azules model could serve as a blueprint for future developments, demonstrating a pathway to maximize in-country value while minimizing environmental impact.   

Key Corporate Players and Ownership Structures
The composition of corporate players in Argentina's mining sector reflects its diverse mineral endowment and evolving investment appeal. The landscape is populated by a mix of global supermajors, established precious metals producers, specialized lithium companies, and agile mid-tier developers.

Global Supermajors: The renewed interest of the world's largest diversified mining companies is a defining feature of the current moment, particularly in the copper sector. Glencore has established a commanding position with 100% ownership of the El Pachón and MARA (Agua Rica) mega-projects, and historical ownership of the Aguilar mine. BHP has entered the country in a significant way through its 50% stake in the Vicuña Corporation joint venture with Lundin Mining, which controls the Josemaría and Filo del Sol projects. Rio Tinto is participating through its Nuton technology venture, which holds a strategic 17.2% equity stake in the Los Azules project, and is also developing the Rincón lithium project. Newmont, while having reduced its direct operational footprint, retains exposure through its legacy partnership in the closed Alumbrera mine, whose infrastructure is key to the MARA project. The commitment of these giants, catalyzed by the RIGI framework, provides a powerful validation of Argentina's long-term resource potential.   

Precious Metals Giants: The backbone of Argentina's current gold and silver production is formed by a cohort of major international producers. Barrick Gold co-owns and operates the giant Veladero mine in a 50/50 joint venture with Shandong Gold and is assessing the future of the adjacent Lama deposit. AngloGold Ashanti operates the long-running Cerro Vanguardia mine in Santa Cruz. Pan American Silver, a major silver producer, operates the Cerro Moro mine and holds the undeveloped Navidad deposit. SSR Mining controls the integrated Puna Operations (Chinchillas mine and Pirquitas plant) in Jujuy.   

Lithium Specialists: The lithium boom has been driven by a group of specialized companies. Arcadium Lithium, the entity formed by the merger of Allkem and Livent, is now the dominant player, controlling both the Salar de Olaroz and the Salar del Hombre Muerto (Fénix) operations. Chinese powerhouse Ganfeng Lithium is a major partner in the newly producing Cauchari-Olaroz project, and French group Eramet now wholly owns the Centenario-Ratones DLE plant.   

Mid-Tiers & Developers: A dynamic group of mid-tier companies and exploration-focused developers are driving the next wave of projects. McEwen Mining and its subsidiary McEwen Copper are advancing the Los Azules project and hold a stake in the San José mine. First Quantum Minerals is developing the Taca Taca copper project. Lundin Mining is BHP's partner in the Vicuña district. Fortuna Silver Mines operates the Lindero gold mine, and Cerrado Gold is expanding the Don Nicolás operation.   

State-Owned Entities: A notable feature of the ownership structure in several key projects is the participation of provincial state-owned mining companies. These entities, such as Fomicruz in Santa Cruz (7.5% of Cerro Vanguardia) and JEMSE in Jujuy (8.5% of Cauchari-Olaroz), typically hold minority, non-operating stakes. This model ensures that the provinces have direct participation in the economic benefits of resource extraction within their territories. A unique case is YMAD, an intergovernmental company with participation from the national government, provincial government, and a national university, which operates the Farallón Negro mine in Catamarca.   

Future Trajectory and Strategic Outlook (to 2035)
Argentina's mining sector is poised for a period of unprecedented growth over the next decade, driven by the parallel development of its lithium and copper resources. The country's trajectory is set to fundamentally restructure its export economy and elevate its standing as a critical supplier in global mineral markets.

The most dramatic shift is expected around the turn of the decade. Based on the publicly stated timelines for key copper projects—with both Los Azules and Josemaría targeting first production around 2030—a massive surge in mineral production and export revenue is anticipated to begin in the early 2030s. The combined output from just a few of these mega-projects could potentially double or triple Argentina's current mining export value, providing a vital source of foreign currency and economic stimulus.   

In the lithium sector, the next phase of development will be defined by a crucial technological contest between conventional evaporation methods and advanced Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE). While established operations like Olaroz rely on large-scale evaporation ponds, the newest generation of projects, including Arcadium's expanded Fénix operation and Eramet's Centenario-Ratones plant, are pioneering the industrial-scale application of DLE. DLE technologies promise significantly higher lithium recovery rates, a much smaller environmental footprint, and faster processing times from brine to final product. However, they are also more technically complex and capital-intensive. The operational success and economic performance of these early DLE plants will be closely watched by the industry and will likely determine the technological pathway for the next wave of Argentine lithium projects. A successful rollout of DLE could solidify Argentina's position as a leader not only in resource volume but also in sustainable and efficient production technology.   

Despite the immense potential, the primary bottleneck constraining the pace and scale of this growth is the deficit in supporting infrastructure. The development of the giant copper mines in the high Andes is contingent upon the construction of new high-voltage power lines, substantial upgrades to road and potentially rail networks for transporting millions of tonnes of concentrate, and the implementation of sophisticated and sustainable water management systems in some of the country's most arid regions. The capital required for this enabling infrastructure is substantial and will require coordinated planning between mining companies and both provincial and national governments.   

In conclusion, Argentina stands on the cusp of a historic transformation into a global mining powerhouse. The alignment of world-class geology in minerals essential for the energy transition with a more favorable and stable investment framework has created the conditions to unlock decades of stalled potential. The path forward is clear, but execution risk remains high. Sustained political stability, the effective management of social and environmental governance at the provincial level, and a concerted national effort to build the necessary energy and logistics infrastructure will be the critical factors determining whether Argentina can fully realize its mineral promise by 2035.
