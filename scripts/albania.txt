An Exhaustive Directory and Strategic Analysis of Albania's Mining and Mineral Processing Infrastructure
Section 1: Strategic Overview of Albania's Mineral Sector
This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the mining and mineral processing facilities in the Republic of Albania. It verifies, corrects, and significantly expands upon an initial list of assets to create a definitive directory for strategic planning, investment analysis, and due diligence. The analysis is grounded in a detailed examination of the country's geological endowment, its complex industrial history, and the contemporary regulatory and economic landscape that shapes the sector today.

1.1. Geological Endowment and Historical Context
Albania's substantial mineral wealth is a direct consequence of its unique geological setting. The nation's geology is dominated by two primary ophiolitic belts, an eastern and a western one, which represent the remnants of the Jurassic-era Neotethys Ocean floor that were obducted onto the continental margin. This geological foundation has endowed the country with globally significant deposits of chromite, volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) copper ores, and extensive nickel-cobalt laterites, forming the bedrock of its extractive industries.   

The history of Albanian mining can be understood through a distinct cycle of state-driven boom, post-socialist collapse, and a modern reconstruction phase fueled by foreign capital.

The Socialist Era (1944-1990s): A Pillar of the State
During the socialist period under Enver Hoxha, the mining industry was elevated to a primary pillar of the state's centrally planned, autarkic economy. The sector was developed at a massive scale to achieve industrial self-sufficiency and to generate crucial foreign currency. This era was epitomized by the slogan, “Kromi çan bllokadën” (“Chromium against the blockade”), which underscored the strategic importance of the country's vast chromite resources in overcoming its profound international isolation.   

By the 1980s, Albania had become the world's third-largest producer of chromite, with annual output exceeding one million metric tons. This period saw the establishment of the country's most significant mining and processing assets. The Bulqizë chromite mine, which commenced operations in 1948, became the heart of the industry. The state also developed a vertically integrated processing chain, opening the Burrel Ferrochrome Plant in 1979 and the Elbasan Ferrochrome Plant in 1988. The copper sector was similarly developed, with mines such as the one at Spaç becoming major producers, though infamous for their use of political prison labor. Coal mining, particularly at the Valias mine near Tirana, was also established to fuel domestic industry.   

Post-Socialist Collapse and Privatization
The political and economic upheaval of the early 1990s precipitated a near-total collapse of this state-run industrial complex. The transition to a market economy exposed the profound inefficiencies, outdated technology, and lack of commercial viability that characterized the socialist-era enterprises. Lacking investment and facing depressed global commodity prices, the vast majority of mines and plants were shuttered. The coal mines were among the first to close, followed by most iron-nickel operations and a drastic reduction in chromium and copper output.   

This period of industrial decay created a vacuum that set the stage for the next phase of the sector's evolution. The approval of the first modern Mining Law in 1994 officially opened the door to private ownership and foreign investment, marking a fundamental and irreversible shift in the structure and stewardship of Albania's mineral resources.   

The Modern "Reconstruction" Phase
The 21st century has been characterized by a selective revival and reconstruction of the mining sector, driven almost exclusively by foreign direct investment. This phase is not a simple continuation of past activities but a strategic acquisition and modernization of legacy assets by international corporations. The involvement of major Turkish and Chinese firms, in particular, points to a broader geopolitical dynamic where Albania's resources are viewed as strategic assets for securing raw material supply chains for major industrial economies. Turkish conglomerate YILDIRIM Group's acquisition of the primary chromium assets through its subsidiary AlbChrome, and the formation of the Beralb consortium by Turkish and Chinese interests (including Jiangxi Copper) to control key copper mines, are prime examples of this trend. These investments are built upon the physical foundations of the socialist era, inheriting both the established infrastructure and the significant environmental liabilities of that period.   

1.2. Regulatory and Investment Landscape
The modern Albanian mining sector operates within a legal framework designed to attract and manage private investment. Several key governmental bodies oversee its activities.

Governing Bodies: The Ministry of Infrastructure and Energy, currently led by Minister Belinda Balluku, is the principal government department responsible for setting national policy for the energy and mineral sectors. Beneath the ministry, two specialized agencies manage the operational aspects of the industry. The National Agency of Natural Resources (NANR) is tasked with negotiating mining agreements with private companies and supervising compliance with the terms of exploitation permits. The Albanian Geological Survey (AGS) is responsible for geological research and the monitoring and evaluation of exploration permits.   

Legal Framework: The primary legislation governing the sector is Law No. 10 304/2010 on the Mining Sector. This law establishes the process for granting mineral rights, which are categorized into three main types of permits: reconnaissance, exploration, and exploitation. An exploitation permit for metallic and non-metallic minerals is typically granted for an initial period of 25 years, which can be renewed for an additional 10 years. To enhance transparency, Albania has established a digital public register of mining licenses, which is maintained as part of its commitment to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).   

Economic Contribution: The extractive industries remain a vital component of the Albanian economy. According to recent data, the sector accounts for approximately 4.2% of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), 17% of its total exports, and 11% of all government revenues. This significant economic footprint underscores the strategic importance of the mining industry to Albania's national development and fiscal stability.   

Section 2: The Chromium and Ferrochrome Sector: Albania's Premier Mineral Asset
The chromium and ferrochrome sector is the cornerstone of Albania's mining industry and its most significant contributor to the global minerals market. The country's reputation is built on the exceptional quality of its chromite ore, which is prized for its metallurgical characteristics and allows for a vertically integrated production chain from mine to finished ferroalloy.

2.1. Sector Analysis
Albania's global standing in the chromium market is derived from the high-grade nature of its ore, particularly from the deposits within the Bulqizë Massif. This ore is recognized as being among the finest in the world, characterized by a high chrome-to-iron ratio that frequently exceeds 3:1 and a high chromium(III) oxide (Cr 
2
​
 O

​
 ) content, often above 38%. This premium quality makes it ideal for direct shipping to smelters and for the production of High Carbon Ferrochrome, a critical alloy for stainless steel manufacturing.   

The sector is overwhelmingly dominated by a single corporate entity: AlbChrome Sh.p.k., a subsidiary of the Turkish industrial conglomerate Yılmaden Holding, which is part of the larger YILDIRIM Group. AlbChrome controls the most significant chromite mines and all major ferrochrome production facilities in the country. This has created a powerful, vertically integrated "mine-to-smelter" operational model that encompasses the extraction of ore, its enrichment, and its final processing into ferrochrome for export. This structure provides the company with substantial control over costs, logistics, and market strategy, making it difficult for smaller, non-integrated players to compete effectively.   

Beyond chromium, Albania's ophiolitic massifs hold significant, largely unexploited potential for high-value strategic metals. Geological studies have identified notable occurrences of Platinum Group Elements (PGEs)—including platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), rhodium (Rh), and osmium (Os)—directly associated with the chromite bodies in the Tropoja and Bulqiza massifs. While chromite remains the exclusive focus of current commercial operations, these associated precious metals represent a substantial potential upside that could fundamentally alter the economics of these mines if exploited.   

2.2. Detailed Chromite Mine Profiles
The heart of Albania's chromium production is concentrated in several key mines, primarily located within the ultramafic massifs of the country's northeastern regions.

Bulqizë Mine ("Bulquize Combine")
Location: Dibër County, approximately 40 km east of Tirana. Coordinates: 41.494, 20.229 [User List]; 41°29′05″N 20°12′14″E.   

Asset Type: Underground Mine and adjacent Processing Plant.

Commodities: Primary: Chromite, Chromium. Secondary: Tungsten [User List]. Other: Natural Hydrogen.   

Status: Operational. Owned and operated by AlbChrome Sh.p.k..   

Details: The Bulqizë mine is the largest and most strategically important chromium reserve in Albania and ranks among the most significant in Europe. With geological reserves estimated at 12 million metric tons, it has been the backbone of the nation's chromium industry since it began production in 1948. The mine is renowned for producing Albania's highest-grade metallurgical chromite ore. In a recent and potentially transformative development, researchers have discovered a massive, continuously degassing reservoir of high-purity natural hydrogen deep within the mine's ophiolitic rock formations. This discovery represents one of the largest natural hydrogen flow rates ever recorded and positions the mine as a potential source of clean energy, adding a new and strategically vital dimension to its asset profile.   

Klos Combine
Location: Klos, Dibër County. Coordinates: 41.502, 20.09 [User List].

Asset Type: Mine and Enrichment Plant.

Commodities: Primary: Chromite, Chromium.

Status: Operational. Operated by AlbChrome Sh.p.k..   

Details: The Klos facility serves as a critical logistical and processing hub within AlbChrome's integrated network. It functions primarily as an enrichment plant, upgrading the ore extracted from nearby mines before it is transported to the company's ferrochrome smelters for final processing.

Batra Mine ("Batra/Martanesh")
Location: Dibër County, near the town of Krastë. Coordinates: 41.418, 20.293 [User List]; 41°29′30″N 20°13′19″E.   

Asset Type: Underground Mine.

Commodities: Primary: Chromite, Chromium.

Status: The mine has been operational since 1967 and was privatized in 1999. A new concentration plant recently commenced operations at the site.   

Details: As part of the extensive Bulqizë Massif, the Batra mine is another of Europe's largest chromium reserves, with estimated resources of 0.73 million tonnes of proven ore grading a high 38% chromium metal. Reserves below the main level are expected to grade as high as 45%. The mine is a key component of the Bater-Martanesh mining district.   

Krasta Mine
Location: Adjacent to the town of Krastë, Dibër County. Coordinates: 41.43, 20.209 [User List]; 41°25′51″N 20°12′33″E.   

Asset Type: Underground Mine.

Commodities: Primary: Chromite, Chromium. Secondary (potential): Platinum, Cobalt.   

Status: Officially closed in 2006, though certain sections were privatized prior to its closure. The mine contains significant unexploited reserves.   

Details: Also located within the Bulqizë Massif, the Krasta mine holds estimated reserves of 2 million metric tons of high-grade ore grading 40% chromium metal. The geological setting suggests potential for valuable rare metals, although their exploitation is not currently underway.   

Kalimash Mines (1 & 2) and Plant
Location: Near the village of Kalimash, Kukës County. Coordinates: 42.066, 20.319 [User List]; approx. 42°03′N 20°17′E.   

Asset Type: Two historical underground mines (Kalimashi 1 & 2) and a modern, large-scale chrome enrichment plant.

Commodities: Primary: Chromium, Chromite.

Status: The Kalimashi 1 and 2 mines were shut down in 2000 due to financial difficulties. However, the area has seen a major industrial revival. In 2016, the company Illyria Minerals Industry (IMI) completed construction of a new enrichment plant, which is now the largest in the Balkans and a major exporter of chrome concentrate.   

Details: The Kalimash mines are situated within the Kukës Massif, a distinct ophiolitic body from Bulqizë. The establishment of the state-of-the-art IMI plant represents one of the most significant recent investments in Albania's downstream mineral processing capacity, highlighting the continued economic viability of the region's chromite resources.   

Kam Mine
Location: Tropoja district, Kukës County. Coordinates: 42.249, 20.235 [User List]; 42.256, 20.249.   

Asset Type: Mine.

Commodities: Primary: Chromite, Chromium. Other: Associated Platinum Group Elements (PGEs).   

Status: The Tropoja region is an area of active mining, though the specific operational status of the Kam mine is not detailed in available materials.

Details: The Kam mine is located within the Tropoja Ophiolitic Massif, a region known for its high-quality chromite deposits and, critically, for its significant potential for PGE mineralization. Geological research has specifically highlighted the Pac-Kam–Kepenek area for discoveries of platinum-bearing ores, making this region a prime target for future exploration for strategic metals.   

Vlahën Mine (Vllahen)
Location: Has District, Kukës County. Coordinates: 42°14′N 20°06′E.   

Asset Type: Mine.

Commodities: Primary: Chromium, Chromite.

Status: Under development. The asset was fully acquired by the Balfin Group in 2020, with plans to commission the mine for a projected annual production of 100,000 metric tons.   

Details: The Vlahën mine represents the second-largest chromium reserve in Albania, with estimated reserves of 2.56 million metric tons of ore. Located in the Tropojë Massif, its development by a major domestic investment group signifies an important expansion of chromium mining activity outside of the traditional Bulqizë hub.   

Other Chromite Mines
The user-provided list and regional surveys indicate the presence of several other chromite deposits, particularly in the southeastern part of the country. These include the Katjielprrenjas mine (Coordinates: 41.046, 20.573) and the Poljske Pogradec mine (Coordinates: 40.949, 20.619). These are located in the Pogradec district, which is recognized as a chromium-bearing region, though detailed operational data for these specific sites is limited.   

2.3. Ferroalloy Production Hubs
The final stage of Albania's chromium value chain is the conversion of chromite ore into ferrochrome, a process concentrated in two major metallurgical plants.

Elbasan Ferroalloy Plant
Location: Elbasan, Elbasan County. Coordinates: 41.108, 20.079 [User List].

Asset Type: Metallurgical Plant (Smelter).

Commodities: Primary: Ferrochrome. Secondary: Chromium.

Status: Operational. Owned and operated by AlbChrome Sh.p.k..   

Details: Established in 1988, the Elbasan plant is a cornerstone of Albania's heavy industry. It is the primary facility for processing chromite ore from the Bulqizë mine into high-carbon ferrochrome, which is then exported globally. The plant is part of the vast, socialist-era "Steel of the Party" metallurgical complex, which has a deeply problematic legacy of severe environmental pollution that continues to affect the region. In recent years, AlbChrome has invested in refurbishing and upgrading the plant's electric arc furnaces to improve efficiency and performance.   

Burrel Ferrochrome Plant
Location: Burrel, Dibër County.

Asset Type: Metallurgical Plant (Smelter).

Commodities: Primary: Ferrochrome.

Status: Operational. Owned and operated by AlbChrome Sh.p.k..   

Details: Opened in 1979, the Burrel plant is the older of the two major ferrochrome facilities. It operates in tandem with the Elbasan plant, forming the core of AlbChrome's integrated metallurgical production capacity and solidifying the company's control over the entire chromium value chain in Albania.

Section 3: The Copper Sector: A Resurgence Driven by Foreign Investment
Albania's once-prolific copper industry, which fell into disuse after the socialist era, is experiencing a significant revival. This resurgence is not driven by domestic capital but is almost entirely dependent on foreign investment, which has focused on reactivating historical mines and processing facilities in the country's northern regions.

3.1. Sector Analysis
The country's copper resources are predominantly found in Volcanogenic Massive Sulfide (VMS) deposits, which are hosted within the ophiolite complexes of the northern districts of Puka, Mirdita, Has-Kukes, and Shkoder. These deposits are often polymetallic, containing not only copper (primarily as chalcopyrite) but also associated minerals such as pyrite, sphalerite (zinc), and traces of gold and silver.   

After the collapse of the state-run industry, the sector lay dormant until the 21st century. The key player spearheading its revival is Beralb Sh.a., a consortium that was initially a partnership with Turkey's Ekin Maden and later saw the entry of a major global player, China's Jiangxi Copper. Beralb holds a 30-year concession, granted in 2001, for a portfolio of key copper mines and a central processing plant in the north.   

A critical challenge facing the sector is the management of its environmental legacy. The high-sulfide nature of the VMS ore results in tailings that are prone to generating acid mine drainage (AMD). This is a particularly acute problem at the central processing plant in Fushe Arrez, where historical and ongoing waste disposal practices have led to significant water pollution, posing a major operational and reputational risk.   

3.2. Detailed Copper Asset Profiles
The operational footprint of the modern copper sector is concentrated around a "hub-and-spoke" model in the north, with several other historical deposits across the country attracting new exploration interest.

Fushe Arrez (Mine & Plant)
Location: Puka district, Northern Albania. Coordinates: 41.999, 20.052 [User List].

Asset Type: Mine and a central Copper Enrichment/Flotation Plant.

Commodities: Primary: Copper. Secondary: Gold [User List], Silver. The ore is polymetallic, containing chalcopyrite, pyrite, and sphalerite.   

Status: Operational. The plant is the central processing facility for the Beralb consortium, treating ore from the Munella and Lak Roshi mines.   

Details: The Fushe Arrez facility is the most critical piece of infrastructure in the northern copper district. Historically, the plant operated a double flotation circuit to separate a pyrite concentrate, which was used for domestic sulfuric acid production. This practice was abandoned in the late 1990s, and the plant now disposes of pyrite-rich tailings in large impoundments. This has created a severe and ongoing environmental problem, as the oxidation of the pyrite generates AMD that contaminates the Fan River with acidic, metal-laden water, impacting local communities and the regional ecosystem. The entire economic viability of the northern copper operations depends on the continuous and efficient functioning of this single plant.   

Munella Mine & Lak Roshi Mine
Location: Puka district. Ore is transported to the Fushe Arrez plant for processing.   

Asset Type: Mines.

Commodities: Primary: Copper.

Status: Operational. Both mines are operated by Beralb Sh.a..   

Details: These two mines serve as the primary "spokes" feeding the Fushe Arrez "hub." They are the main sources of ore for the Beralb consortium's operations. The Munella deposit, in particular, is considered one of the most important copper resources in the region.   

Reps Mine
Location: Mirdita district. Coordinates: 41.882, 20.069 [User List].

Asset Type: Mine.

Commodities: Primary: Copper.

Status: The mine has a history of operation, but its current specific status is unclear. The Mirdita region contains active enrichment plants, indicating ongoing activity in the district.   

Kurbnesh Perlat Mine
Location: Mirdita district. Coordinates: 41.716, 20.019 [User List].

Asset Type: Past-producing mine with an active exploitation permit.

Commodities: Primary: Copper. Secondary: Gold, Silver, Cobalt.   

Status: The mine was productive from 1979 to 1991. In 2014, the Canadian junior exploration company Arian Resources Corp. acquired the project with plans for its revival.   

Details: This is a high-grade VMS deposit. The acquisition by a Canadian firm is significant as it demonstrates that interest in Albania's copper potential extends beyond the dominant Turkish-Chinese consortium to include Western exploration capital, which could bring new technologies and investment approaches to the sector.   

Golaj Deposit
Location: Has-Kukes region. Coordinates: 42.232, 20.385 [User List]; 42.233, 20.367.   

Asset Type: Deposit.

Commodities: Primary: Copper. Secondary: Lead [User List]. Associated minerals include Baryte and Pyrrhotite.   

Status: Classified as a deposit; it is unclear if it is being actively mined. It is recognized as one of the key copper deposits in the Has-Kukes region.   

Rehove Mine
Location: Korçë County, Southeastern Albania. Coordinates: 40.516, 20.702 [User List]; 40.487, 20.628.   

Asset Type: Historically producing mine.

Commodities: Primary: Copper. Other: The deposit is described as gold-bearing and contains chalcopyrite, pyrite, and sphalerite.   

Status: Currently inactive but has been the subject of modern exploration. The company European Electric Metals Inc. has investigated the property, highlighting its potential for battery metals (copper, nickel, cobalt), which aligns with modern green energy demands.   

Spaç Mine
Location: Mirdita district.

Asset Type: Past-producing mine.

Commodities: Primary: Copper.

Status: Production ceased in 1999. The Turkish company Tete Mining, through its subsidiary TeteAlb, acquired the mine in 2007 with the intention of restarting operations.   

Details: The Spaç mine holds a dark place in Albanian history. From 1966 to 1991, it was operated as a brutal political prison camp where inmates were forced to perform dangerous manual labor to extract copper ore. After Munella, it is considered the second-largest copper mine in Albania, with significant remaining reserves.   

Other Copper Assets
Gjegjan Mine: Located in Shkodër County (Coordinates: 41.940, 20.008), this is another known copper mine in the northern region.   

Shkoder Plant: The city of Shkoder was the site of a former copper wires plant. This downstream processing facility has been identified by the government as a target for new concessionary agreements to encourage investment in value-added manufacturing, transforming copper concentrate into finished products like electrolytic copper and cables.   

Section 4: The Nickel and Iron-Nickel Sector: Untapped Potential
While the chromium sector is mature and the copper sector is undergoing a revival, Albania's nickel sector represents a third major mineral endowment characterized by vast but largely dormant potential. The country hosts significant nickel laterite deposits, but unlike its other base metals, these resources remain significantly underexploited.

4.1. Sector Analysis
Albania possesses geological reserves of nickel laterite estimated to be as large as 300 million metric tons. These deposits, which formed from the lateritic weathering of the country's ultramafic ophiolite rocks, occur in two primary mineralization styles: iron-nickel (Fe-Ni) and nickel-silicate (Ni-Si). The main mineralized zones are concentrated in the regions of Pogradec-Librazhd in the southeast and Kukes in the northeast.   

Despite the immense scale of these resources, the sector is officially described as "quite un-exploited as compared to its potential". Detailed geological surveys have delineated multiple large-scale deposits, yet most of these reserves have seen little to no commercial production. This presents a significant greenfield or brownfield investment opportunity for a large-scale strategic investor capable of developing the necessary mining and processing infrastructure.   

4.2. Addressing the "Rudnici Mine" Data Discrepancy
An initial data review included an asset named "Rudnici Mine" (Coordinates: 41.999, 20.002) listed as a nickel mine in Albania. However, a thorough investigation reveals this to be a data error. There is no evidence in the available geological or industry reports of a major nickel mine by this name within Albania.

The name "Rudnik" (the singular form of Rudnici) is strongly associated with two very famous mining complexes in neighboring countries. The Rudnik Mine in Serbia is a historic and currently operational polymetallic mine producing lead, zinc, copper, and silver. Similarly, the massive Trepça Mines complex in Kosovo is often referred to by its Serbian name, Rudnik Trepča. It is highly probable that the entry in the source list was a case of data conflation, incorrectly assigning the name and commodity of a well-known foreign mine to a location in Albania. This report therefore excludes "Rudnici Mine" from the definitive list of Albanian assets, highlighting the critical importance of rigorous data verification in sectoral analysis.   

4.3. Detailed Nickel Asset Profiles
The true nickel potential of Albania lies in a series of large, well-defined laterite deposits.

Prrenjas Mines
Location: Prrenjas, Elbasan County. Coordinates: 41.099, 20.535 and 41.067, 20.544 [User List].

Asset Type: Mine complex.

Commodities: Primary: Nickel. Secondary: Cobalt. Other: Chromium.   

Status: The former iron-nickel mine is now abandoned, its iconic processing towers standing as a local landmark. The area also has a history of coal mining.   

Details: The Prrenjas deposits are part of the extensive Pogradec-Librazhd nickel-bearing laterite region, which is one of the most significant in the country.   

Guri Kuq Mines
Location: Pogradec region, Korçë County. Coordinates: 40.916, 20.634 and 40.883, 20.674 [User List].

Asset Type: Mine.

Commodities: Primary: Nickel. Secondary: Cobalt, Chromium.   

Status: The mine has a history of production dating back to 1963. A private company is reportedly conducting operations at the site currently.   

Details: The Guri Kuq deposit is one of Albania's premier nickel assets. It is a major iron-nickel deposit with enormous reserves estimated at 53.5 million metric tons. Critically, only about 7% of these reserves have been exploited to date, leaving the vast majority of the resource intact. The name "Guri Kuq," meaning "Red Rock," is a common place name and also refers to a mountain in Kosovo, which can create geographic confusion.   

Bitincke Deposit
Location: Devoll, Korçë County. Coordinates: 40.635, 20.985 [User List]; 40.645, 20.983.   

Asset Type: Nickel laterite deposit.

Commodities: Primary: Nickel. Secondary: Cobalt, Iron.   

Status: A well-defined deposit with significant estimated resources, but it is not currently subject to large-scale exploitation.   

Details: The Bitincke deposit is one of the most thoroughly studied nickel laterites in Albania, with an estimated resource of 35.6 million metric tons grading 1.2% nickel. The nickel mineralization occurs in silicate forms, including the minerals garnierite and népouite, which are typical of lateritic weathering profiles developed on ophiolitic bedrock.   

Other Major Nickel Deposits
A 2008 report by the Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC) identified several other large, unexploited nickel deposits, primarily in the Kukes region. These include:   

Bushtrica Mine: (Coordinates: 41.116, 20.469) Located in the Pogradec-Librazhd region.

Trull-Surroj Deposit: Located in the Kukes region, with estimated reserves of 29.4 million tons (Fe-Ni and Ni-Si).

Mamez Deposit: Located in the Kukes region, with estimated reserves of 36.5 million tons (Fe-Ni and Ni-Si).

Nome Deposit: Located in the Kukes region, with estimated reserves of 14 million tons (Ni-Si).

For each of these Kukes-region deposits, the report explicitly states that the reserves "are not exploited up to now," reinforcing the theme of the sector's vast dormant potential.   

Section 5: Coal and Other Mineral Resources
In addition to its significant metallic ore deposits, Albania also possesses resources of mineral fuels, primarily lignite coal. While historically important for domestic energy, the coal sector has been largely inactive since the 1990s.

5.1. Detailed Asset Profiles
Valius Coal Mine (Valias Mine)
Location: Kamëz, Tiranë County. Coordinates: 41.392, 19.736 [User List]; 41.391, 19.735.   

Asset Type: Underground Coal Mine.

Commodities: Primary: Thermal Coal (Lignite).

Status: Historically productive, now closed. The mine operated from 1978 until 1994.   

Details: Albania's coal resources consist mainly of low-calorific value lignite, with the largest deposits located in the Tirana area. The Valias mine, situated near the capital, was one of the country's most significant coal producers during the socialist era, producing over 3.5 million tons during its operational life. In line with the broader industrial collapse, Valias was among the first major mines to be closed in the early 1990s due to its lack of profitability in a market economy. There have been discussions within the government about the potential reactivation of these coal mines, framed as a strategy to mitigate acute social problems in former mining areas and to provide a domestic fuel source for local industries.   

Section 6: Comprehensive Directory and Strategic Outlook
This final section consolidates the detailed findings of the report into a master reference directory of Albania's mining and mineral processing infrastructure. It concludes with a strategic outlook on the future opportunities and persistent challenges that will define the evolution of the sector.

6.2. Concluding Insights and Future Outlook
The analysis of Albania's mining sector reveals an industry defined by a rich geological endowment and a history of dramatic transformation. Its current state is one of fragmented revival, heavily reliant on foreign capital to reactivate and modernize a vast but neglected industrial legacy. The future trajectory of the sector will be shaped by the interplay of several key opportunities and persistent challenges.

Future Opportunities
Exploitation of Strategic Metals: The confirmed presence of Platinum Group Elements (PGEs) and cobalt within Albania's major chromite and copper deposits is the most significant untapped opportunity. A concerted exploration and metallurgical testing program focused on recovering these high-value metals as co-products could dramatically increase the profitability of existing operations and attract new, technologically advanced investors.

The Clean Energy Transition: The discovery of a major natural hydrogen resource at the Bulqizë mine is a potential game-changer. If proven commercially viable, it could position Albania as a unique player in the global transition to clean energy. Furthermore, the country's vast, underexploited nickel and cobalt resources are critical inputs for the battery manufacturing supply chain, representing a major future-facing opportunity.

Investment in Downstream Processing: There remains considerable scope for investment in value-added processing within Albania. The development of a domestic copper smelter would allow the country to export refined metal rather than lower-value concentrate. Similarly, the establishment of a ferronickel plant to process the country's laterite ores could create a new, high-value industrial sector.

Persistent Challenges
The Environmental Legacy: The environmental damage from the socialist era—particularly acid mine drainage from copper tailings and soil contamination around old industrial sites like Elbasan—remains a profound challenge. The costs and technical complexity of remediation will be a significant financial burden and a potential deterrent to investment, while the risk of future regulatory action against polluters remains high.

Infrastructure Deficits: Many of Albania's most promising mineral deposits are located in remote, mountainous regions with inadequate infrastructure. Realizing the potential of these assets will require substantial concurrent investment in roads, reliable power grids, and modern logistical networks.

Data Reliability and Governance: As demonstrated by the "Rudnici Mine" discrepancy, the public data landscape for the Albanian mining sector can contain inaccuracies. This necessitates a high degree of on-the-ground due diligence for any potential investor. Continued efforts to improve transparency, strengthen regulatory oversight, and ensure the consistent application of mining laws will be crucial for building investor confidence and ensuring the sustainable development of the sector.

In conclusion, Albania's mining industry stands at a pivotal juncture. While its traditional chromium sector provides a stable foundation, the future growth and diversification of the industry will depend on its ability to attract strategic investment to unlock the potential of its nickel resources, capitalize on the emerging opportunities in strategic and clean energy metals, and effectively address the deep-seated environmental and infrastructural challenges inherited from its past.
