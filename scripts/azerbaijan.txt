Azerbaijan's Mineral Sector: A Comprehensive Analysis of Mining and Processing Infrastructure
Section 1: Strategic Overview of Azerbaijan's Mining Industry
The Republic of Azerbaijan, a nation whose modern economic history has been overwhelmingly defined by its vast hydrocarbon reserves, is currently engaged in a strategic reorientation aimed at diversifying its economic base. Central to this national imperative is the revitalization and expansion of its mining and mineral processing sector. While the industry's value remains dominated by oil and gas, a concerted state-led effort is underway to unlock the considerable potential of the country's rich deposits of ferrous, non-ferrous, and precious metals. This section provides a strategic overview of this evolving landscape, examining the policy drivers, key corporate actors, and recent performance trends that define Azerbaijan's non-oil mining industry.

1.1 The Non-Oil Imperative: Mining's Role in Economic Diversification
The Azerbaijani government's long-term economic strategy is fundamentally anchored in reducing its dependency on the oil and gas sector. The mining industry has been identified as a primary pillar for this diversification. Statistical data from The State Statistical Committee of the Republic of Azerbaijan underscores the scale of this reliance; in 2023, the total value of industrial production from "Mining and Quarrying" was approximately AZN 45.1 billion, of which a staggering AZN 42.1 billion was attributed to "Crude Petroleum and Natural Gas". However, within this context, the government is actively promoting the non-oil sub-sectors. The value of metal ore extraction, though modest in comparison at USD 217.4 million, is a focal point for state-led investment and development initiatives.   

This policy direction is evidenced by the formalization and modernization of the sector's governance. A pivotal development was the establishment of the State Agency for the Use of Mineral Resources in July 2018 under the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources. This move signaled a significant shift from a passive, Soviet-era resource management model to an active, market-oriented strategy designed to de-risk investment and accelerate development. The agency's mandate is to implement state policy on the geological study and efficient use of mineral resources, manage the state's mineral reserves, and oversee the issuance of mining concessions.   

The proactive stance of this new agency is demonstrated through its recent activities. It has begun to put mineral deposits into operation through a competitive auction process, a mechanism designed to attract private capital and foster a more transparent economic environment. Furthermore, the agency has forged strategic partnerships, such as the Memorandum of Understanding signed with the Azerbaijan Investment Company (AIC) in December 2020. This collaboration aims to jointly research promising mining projects and attract the necessary investment to finance them, indicating a coordinated national effort to commercialize state assets and build a robust, non-oil industrial base. This structured approach, combining centralized policy with market-based mechanisms, is the cornerstone of Azerbaijan's strategy to leverage its significant geological wealth, which includes substantial deposits of gold, copper, iron ore, and polymetallic ores.   

1.2 The Corporate Landscape: Key State and Private Actors
The operational landscape of Azerbaijan's non-oil mining sector is defined by a hybrid model that combines international expertise with state-directed strategic development. This structure is dominated by four key entities, each playing a distinct role in the industry's growth.

Anglo Asian Mining PLC (AAM) is the sector's primary international player. As a UK-based, AIM-listed company, it brings access to international capital markets, technical expertise, and adherence to global reporting standards such as JORC. AAM operates under a Production Sharing Agreement (PSA) with the government, a model typically used in the oil and gas industry to provide long-term stability for foreign investors. The company has a long and successful operational history in Azerbaijan, focused on producing gold, copper, and silver from its portfolio of assets primarily located in the country's west.   

AzerGold CJSC is the state-owned national mining champion. Established by presidential decree in 2015, AzerGold was created to consolidate, develop, and manage the state's strategic non-ferrous and ferrous metal ore deposits. The company has been tasked with spearheading some of the nation's most ambitious and capital-intensive projects, including the revival of the Dashkesan iron ore complex and the development of the world-class Filizchay polymetallic deposit. Its creation reflects a deliberate strategy to maintain sovereign control over key national resources while building domestic operational capacity.   

Azeraluminium LLC holds a monopoly as the sole primary aluminum producer not only in Azerbaijan but in the entire South Caucasus region. The company operates the large-scale Ganja Aluminum Complex, which includes facilities for refining alunite ore into alumina and smelting it into primary aluminum and semi-finished products. It is a critical component of the country's non-ferrous industrial base.   

Baku Steel Company CJSC is the country's leading steel producer. The company operates a modern steel plant in Baku utilizing Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) technology, along with downstream pipe rolling and ferroalloy production facilities in Sumgayit. It is the anchor of the domestic ferrous metals industry.   

The parallel operations of Anglo Asian Mining and AzerGold represent a deliberate dual-track development strategy. This model allows the Azerbaijani government to leverage the validation, technology, and capital that a publicly-traded international company like AAM brings, particularly for its established gold and copper assets. Simultaneously, it uses its national champion, AzerGold, to undertake projects of significant scale and strategic national importance that may have longer investment horizons or greater political complexity. This approach effectively balances the need for foreign direct investment with the state's objective of maintaining control over its most strategic mineral endowments.

1.3 Production and Economic Contribution: A Statistical Snapshot
The output of Azerbaijan's non-oil mineral sector provides a tangible measure of its economic contribution and recent trajectory. While production volumes can exhibit volatility based on ore grades, operational factors, and global commodity prices, the data reveals a sector with established production streams and significant growth potential.

In 2019, the country's three main cement plants—Norm Sement, OJSC Holcim (Azerbaijan), and Qazax Sement—produced approximately 3.5 million metric tons of cement. In the metals sector, raw steel production, solely from Baku Steel Company, was recorded at 326,400 metric tons in the same year.   

Precious and base metals production has been a key driver of the non-oil sector's export value. In 2017, the country produced 1,895 kg of gold and 1,947 metric tons of copper. This followed a period of significant growth, with silver and copper output increasing by 141% and 101% respectively in 2016, largely due to the ramp-up of new mining phases at Anglo Asian's operations. However, the sector is also sensitive to the performance of its key assets. For example, in 2023, AAM's gold production fell to 21,758 ounces from 43,114 ounces in 2022, and copper production decreased to 2,138 tonnes from 2,516 tonnes the previous year. This decline was attributed to maturing ore bodies and a temporary suspension of operations at its main Gedabek mine for environmental assessments, highlighting the operational risks inherent in the industry.   

The following table provides a concise overview of the sector's key performance indicators, illustrating its scale and recent performance.

Indicator	Value/Volume (2017)	Value/Volume (2019)	Value/Volume (2023)	Data Source(s)

Section 2: Ferrous Metals Value Chain: From Ore to Steel
Azerbaijan is methodically constructing an integrated ferrous metals value chain, a strategic industrial endeavor designed to transform domestic iron ore into high-value steel products. This initiative stretches from the historic mining district of Dashkesan to the modern industrial hubs of Baku, Sumgayit, and Ganja. At its core is the state-led revival of the nation's largest iron ore complex, a project directly linked to the capabilities of its primary steel producer. This section provides a detailed examination of this value chain, from resource extraction to finished product.

2.1 The Dashkesan Iron Ore Complex: A Strategic Revival
The Dashkesan iron ore complex, located in the Lesser Caucasus, is the cornerstone of Azerbaijan's ferrous metals ambitions. It is the largest iron ore resource in the region, comprising a cluster of six deposits: North-east, North-west, South-east, South-west, Damirov, and Dardara. The total industrial reserves of the Dashkesan group are estimated to be around 270-309 million tonnes, with an iron content ranging between 35% and 40%.   

Historically, the complex was a significant producer during the Soviet era, with intensive mining from 1954 to 1994, after which operations became intermittent and eventually ceased. The modern revival of this strategic asset began in 2020, when the President of Azerbaijan tasked the state-owned mining company, AzerGold CJSC, with its redevelopment. Through its dedicated subsidiary, Dashkasan Iron Ore LLC, AzerGold recommenced mining operations at the Southeast deposit in June 2022, marking a new era for the complex.   

The redevelopment plan is not merely to restart mining but to execute an ambitious, three-stage megaproject aimed at maximizing the value of the ore. This integrated strategy addresses the challenges of the deposit's relatively low-grade ore and its landlocked location by focusing on the production of high-value, processed materials. The three stages are:   

Stage 1: Beneficiation Plant: A modern processing plant will be constructed adjacent to the mine site. Its purpose is to upgrade the raw ore into a high-grade iron ore concentrate with an iron content exceeding 67%, making it suitable for further processing.   

Stage 2: Pelletizing Plant: This facility will take the iron ore concentrate and process it into pellets, a uniform feedstock required for the final stage of production.   

Stage 3: Hot Briquetted Iron (HBI) Plant: This is the most capital-intensive and strategically significant component of the project. A joint venture with Kazakhstan's Fonte GreenMet Investments Fund OEIC LLC has been established to build a state-of-the-art HBI plant in the Shamkir region. With a projected annual capacity of 2 million tons and an estimated investment of USD 700 million, this plant will produce a premium, low-impurity metallic iron product suitable for high-quality steelmaking and for export.   

The project is advancing, with the Bankable Feasibility Study (BFS) for the beneficiation and pelletizing stages being conducted by China's Sinosteel Equipment & Engineering Co., Ltd. The entire three-plant complex is targeted for commissioning by mid-2027. This project is a clear example of strategic industrial policy; it transforms a domestic raw material into a high-value product, creating a fully integrated value chain. This will reduce the nation's import dependency for high-quality steel feedstock and establish Azerbaijan as a regional exporter of a premium metallic product. The choice of HBI technology is also a forward-looking decision. As a key feedstock for lower-carbon steel production in Electric Arc Furnaces, it positions Azerbaijan's future steel industry to be more environmentally competitive in a world increasingly focused on decarbonization.   

2.2 Steel and Ferroalloy Production: Baku Steel Company and Associates
The downstream anchor of the ferrous value chain is Baku Steel Company (BSC), the first modern steel plant in the Caucasus and the country's sole producer of raw steel. BSC's operations are centered in the industrial cities of Baku and Sumgayit.   

Baku Steel Company (BSC) - Baku Plant:
Located in the Narimanov district of Baku, this is the company's primary steelmaking facility. The plant operates two Electric Arc Furnaces (EAFs) with a combined crude steel production capacity of 800,000 tonnes per year. The feedstock for these furnaces consists of a mix of iron scrap, Direct Reduced Iron (DRI), and HBI. This direct link to feedstock highlights the strategic importance of the future Dashkesan HBI plant, which will provide a secure, high-quality domestic source of premium raw material, reducing reliance on volatile international scrap and metallics markets. The Baku plant's output includes a range of semi-finished and finished products, such as steel billets, construction rebar, wire rods, and other rolled products like channels and angles.   

Baku Steel Company - Sumgayit Facilities:
BSC's operations in the industrial city of Sumgayit focus on specialized downstream products.

The "Azerboru" Production Site manufactures seamless steel pipes. This facility is a critical supplier to Azerbaijan's dominant oil and gas industry, producing casing pipes for exploration and production activities.   

The Ferroalloys Plant, operating under the name "AzFerAl," produces ferrosilicon (up to FeSi75 grade), an essential deoxidizing and alloying agent used in the steelmaking process. The plant has an annual production capacity of 18,000 tonnes.   

The long-term vision for Azerbaijan's steel industry extends beyond current capacity. In 2018, Baku Steel Company signed an agreement with CAMC Engineering of China for the construction of a new USD 1.17 billion metal-processing plant in Ganja, to be called the Azerbaijan Integrated Steel Mill complex. While the current status of this project is not detailed, its conception indicates a strategic ambition to significantly expand the nation's steel production capabilities in the future.   

Section 3: Non-Ferrous and Precious Metals Operations
The non-ferrous and precious metals sector represents the most developed and internationally visible segment of Azerbaijan's non-oil mining industry. Dominated by the activities of Anglo Asian Mining PLC and the state-owned AzerGold CJSC, this sector is characterized by modern mining and processing techniques, adherence to international standards, and a focus on gold, copper, and silver. Both leading companies have independently developed a "hub-and-spoke" operational model, a highly efficient strategy for exploiting the region's clustered ore bodies. This section details the operational portfolios of these key players and examines the country's aluminum production industry.

3.1 Anglo Asian Mining PLC (AAM) Portfolio: The Gedabek Hub and Beyond
Anglo Asian Mining's operations are centered around its Gedabek Contract Area, which functions as a centralized processing hub for a network of surrounding mines. This strategy minimizes capital expenditure by avoiding the need to build standalone processing plants for smaller satellite deposits, thereby maximizing resource recovery from the entire mineral district.

Gedabek Contract Area (Gadabay District): This is the operational and processing core of AAM in Azerbaijan.

Mines:

Gedabek Open Pit: The company's main and most mature mine, which has historically been the primary source of gold, copper, and silver ore.   

Gadir & Gedabek Underground Mines: A connected network of underground tunnels that access higher-grade polymetallic ore. The Gadir mine, which began stope production in September 2015, is a well-established and active part of the operation.   

Gilar Mine: A new underground mine focused on copper and gold. It represents a key component of AAM's strategic shift towards copper, with production having commenced in mid-2024.   

Processing Facilities: All ore from AAM's mines is processed at the centralized facilities located within the Gedabek contract area.

Agitation Leaching Plant: Utilizes cyanide leaching to recover gold and silver, which are then poured into gold doré bars.   

Flotation Plant: This plant processes sulphide ores to produce a copper concentrate that also contains significant amounts of gold and silver. The plant's capacity was doubled in 2023 to support the increasing focus on copper ores.   

SART (Sulphidization, Acidification, Recycling, and Thickening) Plant: An advanced processing unit that recovers additional copper from the leach solution and regenerates cyanide for reuse, improving both economic and environmental efficiency.   

Heap Leach Pads: Used for the extraction of metals from lower-grade crushed and run-of-mine ore.   

Gosha Contract Area (Gadabay District): Located approximately 50 km from the main hub, Gosha is a small, high-grade underground gold and silver mine. Ore mined at Gosha is transported by road to the Gedabek facilities for processing, perfectly illustrating the hub-and-spoke model in action.   

Development & Exploration Pipeline: AAM's future is heavily influenced by its strategic pivot from a gold-centric producer to a copper-focused company. This shift is a direct response to the maturation of its primary gold deposits and a series of major copper discoveries. This forward-thinking strategy positions the company to capitalize on the increasing global demand for copper driven by the green energy transition.

Xarxar & Garadag (Gadabay District): These two large contract areas, located near Gedabek, are central to the company's copper strategy. Xarxar contains a JORC-compliant mineral resource of 119,100 tonnes of copper, while Garadag holds a substantial non-JORC internal estimate of 324,000 tonnes of copper.   

Vejnaly (Zangilan District): A gold deposit located in territory that returned to Azerbaijani control in 2020. Stockpiled ore from the site has already been processed at Gedabek, and a technical study is underway to assess the economics of restarting full-scale mining.   

Kyzlbulag & Demirli (Karabakh): These contract areas contain a historic copper-molybdenum mine and an intact plant. While AAM holds the rights, it does not currently have physical access to the site.   

Ordubad (Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic): An early-stage exploration project for gold and copper, representing a frontier of potential growth for the company.   

3.2 AzerGold CJSC Portfolio: The Chovdar Hub and National Projects
Following a similar operational logic to AAM, the state-owned AzerGold has established its own hub-and-spoke system, the Chovdar Integrated Regional Processing Area (CIRPA), to develop a cluster of deposits in the Dashkesan and Goygol districts.

Chovdar Integrated Regional Processing Area (CIRPA) (Dashkesan District):

Mines:

Chovdar Gold Mine: AzerGold's flagship operation, which commenced production in 2017. The mine has two distinct phases: the initial oxide (near-surface) ore phase, which is now complete, and the ongoing sulphide (deeper) ore phase.   

Aghyokhush Mine (Goygol District): A cluster of satellite gold deposits located 14 km from the Chovdar plant. The Aghyokhush-1 deposit was mined out between November 2020 and December 2021. The development of Aghyokhush-2 and other satellite zones is planned for the future. The proximity to Chovdar allows for exploitation without the need for significant new infrastructure investment.   

Marah Mine (Dashkesan District): A small gold deposit near Chovdar that was brought into operation in July 2021.   

Tulallar Mine (Goygol District): The fourth gold deposit commissioned by AzerGold, with mining operations starting in February 2023. Ore from Tulallar is transported to CIRPA for processing.   

Processing Facilities (at CIRPA):

Heap Leach Facilities: Used for processing the oxide ores from the initial phase of the Chovdar mine.

Carbon-in-Leach (CIL) Plant: A new, high-efficiency processing plant commissioned in 2024. This plant is crucial for treating the more complex sulphide ores from the second phase of Chovdar, as well as ores from Tulallar, Marah, and future satellite mines. It has an annual ore grinding capacity of 1.1 million tons and is expected to achieve gold recovery rates of up to 90%.   

Major Development Projects:
Beyond its current operations, AzerGold is responsible for developing some of the nation's most significant and strategic undeveloped mineral assets.

Filizchay Polymetallic Deposit (Balakan District): A world-class deposit of zinc, lead, copper, and silver. (See Section 5.1 for a detailed analysis).

Mazymchay Deposit (Balakan District): Another polymetallic deposit located near Filizchay, which is planned for commissioning in 2027, likely to be developed in conjunction with the larger Filizchay project.   

Ortakand-Khanagha Field (Nakhchivan AR): A highly prospective area in the Nakhchivan exclave currently under evaluation for gold and copper-porphyry style mineralization.

3.3 Aluminum Production: The Ganja Industrial Complex
Azerbaijan's aluminum industry is consolidated under a single operator, Azeraluminium LLC, which runs an integrated production complex in the country's second-largest city, Ganja.

Raw Material Source: The primary raw material for Azerbaijan's aluminum industry is alunite, not the more common bauxite. The feedstock is sourced from the Zaglik alunite deposit, located in the Dashkesan region. This deposit is noted as being the largest of its kind in Europe, providing a substantial domestic resource base for the industry. A key part of the industry's expansion strategy involves the further development of the Dashkesan alunite mine to ensure a stable supply of local raw materials.   

Ganja Alumina Refinery: This facility is responsible for the first stage of processing, refining the alunite ore to produce alumina (aluminum oxide). The refinery is slated for a major modernization project aimed at increasing its annual production capacity to between 450,000 and 480,000 tonnes.   

Ganja Aluminum Complex (Smelter): This is the main production facility where alumina is converted into aluminum metal via an electrolysis process.

Capacity: The smelter currently has an annual production capacity of 54,000 tonnes of primary aluminum. Ambitious expansion plans are in place to increase this capacity to 200,000 tonnes per year.   

Downstream Facilities: The Ganja complex is highly integrated, featuring several downstream processing units. These include an anode plant, a casting and continuous rolling workshop, and a pressure treatment and painting workshop. This integration allows Azeraluminium to produce not only primary aluminum ingots but also semi-finished products such as aluminum coils and sheets.   

Sumgayit Facilities: While the primary complex is in Ganja, the industrial city of Sumgayit is also mentioned as a site for the modernization of aluminum facilities, suggesting the presence of historic or secondary processing plants in that location. The initial data provided for this report also listed a "Sumgait Smelter" as a potential alternative name for the main Ganja facility, indicating a strong historical association of the industry with both cities.   

Section 4: Industrial Minerals and Construction Materials Sector
While the metals sector attracts the most international attention, Azerbaijan's industrial minerals and construction materials sector forms a vital foundation for the domestic economy. This segment is crucial for supporting national infrastructure development, a burgeoning construction industry, and other industrial applications. The geographical distribution of these operations is closely tied to local demand from population centers and major development projects, such as the large-scale reconstruction efforts in the Karabakh region. Unlike the export-oriented metals sector, this industry is primarily focused on ensuring national self-sufficiency in essential materials.   

4.1 Cement Production
Azerbaijan possesses a robust domestic cement production capacity, sufficient to meet the demands of its construction industry. The country has three major cement plants with a combined annual production capacity of 5.6 million metric tons. These facilities are:   

Norm Sement

OJSC Holcim (Azerbaijan)

Qazax Sement

These plants source their primary raw material, limestone, from extensive local deposits. The Karadag region, in particular, is noted for having raw materials suitable for cement production, including limestone and clay.   

4.2 Bentonite, Gypsum, and Salt
The country is also endowed with significant deposits of key industrial minerals used in various applications from drilling to food production.

Bentonite: This versatile clay is used as a drilling mud in the oil and gas industry, among other applications. The sole producer of bentonite in the country is JV AzRosPromInvest. The company mines the Dash-Salakhlinskoye bentonite deposit located in the Qazax region, which has estimated resources of 83 million metric tons. Azerbaijan has other large, undeveloped bentonite deposits, including the Aploidskoye deposit and the Khyzyn group of deposits, with combined resources of about 180 million metric tons.   

Gypsum: Used in the production of plasterboard and as an additive in cement, gypsum deposits are found in chalk formations in the Gadabay region, specifically in the villages of Upper Agjakend and Manash. There are also significant commercial reserves located near the city of Ganja.   

Rock Salt: Azerbaijan has vast rock salt resources, primarily located in the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The main deposits are Nehram, Duzdag, and Pusyan, which are found in Miocene-era geological formations. The commercial reserves of the Duzdag field alone are over 94 million tonnes, with total potential resources in the region estimated to be as high as 2-2.5 billion tonnes.   

4.3 Other Industrial and Construction Materials
The State Balance of Mineral Resources confirms a wide variety of other industrial and construction materials distributed across the country, supporting a diverse range of local industries.   

Dolomite: Large deposits are located near the village of Nehram in the Nakhchivan AR and at Boyanata Mountain in the Gobustan region. Dolomite is used as a flux in metallurgy and for producing certain types of glass.   

Quartz Sand: High-quality quartz sand suitable for the glass industry is found in the Gobustan region, the Absheron Peninsula, and the Guba region.   

Facing and Building Stone: Azerbaijan has numerous quarries for high-quality facing stones like marble and travertine. Key deposits are located in Dashkesan and Shakhtakhty (Nakhchivan AR). There are also dozens of deposits of saw stone (limestone, tuff) and building stone across the country.   

Barite: Primarily used as a weighting agent in drilling fluids, there are nearly 20 known barite deposits and occurrences in Azerbaijan, including those at Chovdar, Bashgishlag, and Gushchu.   

Section 5: Undeveloped Deposits and Future Growth Frontiers
The future trajectory of Azerbaijan's mining industry will be defined by its ability to develop a portfolio of large, untapped mineral deposits. The successful commissioning of these assets, particularly the world-class Filizchay project, has the potential to fundamentally alter the scale, diversity, and economic impact of the entire sector. This section assesses these future growth frontiers, including major polymetallic projects, the underexplored potential of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, and the strategic resources located in the Karabakh region.

5.1 The Filizchay Polymetallic Project: A World-Class Asset in Waiting
The Filizchay deposit, located in the Balakan district on the southern slope of the Greater Caucasus mountains, represents the single most significant undeveloped mineral asset in Azerbaijan. It is a sedimentary exhalative (SEDEX) type deposit, a geological formation style known for hosting very large accumulations of base metals. Filizchay is recognized as one of the largest undeveloped polymetallic deposits in Europe and ranks highly on a global scale for its reserves.   

Operator: The development of this strategic national asset has been entrusted to the state-owned AzerGold CJSC.   

Resource Base: The deposit contains a massive resource base primarily of zinc and lead, with significant credits of copper, silver, and gold. In 2022, an updated resource calculation compliant with the international JORC standard confirmed an underground ore resource of 112.71 million tonnes.   

Development Status: The project is inherently complex due to its challenging geology and mountainous location. AzerGold is currently conducting detailed metallurgical research to develop the most efficient processing flowsheet and optimal production schemes. The scale of the project necessitates a multi-year development timeline; however, optimization work by AzerGold may allow for an accelerated schedule. A trial mining operation is tentatively planned to begin in 2025, with the construction and commissioning of a full-scale industrial processing plant to follow in the subsequent years.   

The development of Filizchay will be a transformative event for Azerbaijan's economy. It will mark the country's emergence as a globally significant producer of base metals, particularly zinc and lead. This will fundamentally shift the commodity profile of its non-oil exports, which are currently focused on gold and copper, thereby diversifying revenue streams and elevating the nation's position in global industrial metal supply chains.

5.2 Mineral Potential of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic
The Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, an exclave of Azerbaijan, holds considerable mineral wealth that remains largely underexplored and undeveloped by modern standards. The region's complex geology is host to a variety of ore deposits.

Lead and Zinc: The Gumushluk and Aghdara deposits have been mined historically and represent known sources of lead and zinc.   

Molybdenum: The Paragachay and Diakhchay deposits in the Ordubad region are known occurrences of molybdenum, a critical alloying metal.   

Bauxite: Deposits of bauxite, the highest-quality raw material for aluminum production, are found in the Sadarak and Sharur areas. These could provide a superior alternative to alunite for the country's aluminum industry in the future.   

Arsenic: The Daridag deposit in the Julfa region is a major arsenic (orpiment-realgar) deposit that was operational until 1941.   

Gold and Copper: The most significant modern exploration activity in the region is being undertaken by Anglo Asian Mining, which holds the Ordubad contract area for early-stage gold and copper exploration.   

5.3 Karabakh's Mineral Resources: A Post-Conflict Opportunity
The territories that came under full Azerbaijani control following the 2020 conflict and subsequent actions contain numerous historically significant mineral deposits. The development of these resources is a top national priority, framed within the government's "Great Return" program for the region. However, this development faces substantial challenges, including the extensive presence of landmines, which requires a massive demining effort before any large-scale industrial activity can safely commence.   

Key deposits located in this region include:

Gold: The Zod (Soyudlu) deposit, which straddles the border, along with the Agduzdag and Vejnali (Zangilan district) deposits.   

Mercury: A cluster of significant mercury deposits, including Agyatag, Levchay, and Shorbulag, are located in the Kalbajar district.   

Chromite: Deposits of chromite, the primary ore of chromium, are found at Goydara (Kalbajar) and Ipek (Lachin).   

Copper and Polymetallics: The Gizylbulag gold-copper-pyrite deposit and the Mehmana lead-zinc deposit are also located in the region. Anglo Asian Mining holds the rights to the Kyzlbulag contract area, which contains the Demirli copper-molybdenum deposit.   

The development of these resources transcends pure economics; it is a tool of statecraft. The successful and transparent commissioning of mines in Karabakh will serve as a powerful geopolitical and economic symbol of sovereignty and state-building for Azerbaijan. The pace and nature of this development, particularly through partnerships with reputable international operators like Anglo Asian at its Vejnaly and Kyzlbulag contract areas, will be a key barometer of the country's ability to attract foreign investment into post-conflict zones and turn a former source of instability into a driver of economic growth.

Section 6: Investment Climate and Regulatory Outlook
A clear and stable regulatory framework is essential for attracting the substantial long-term investment required by the mining sector. Azerbaijan has established a governance structure that combines ministerial oversight with a dedicated executive agency, and it offers several models for investment participation.

6.1 The Regulatory Framework: Key Institutions and Legislation
The legal and administrative oversight of the mining industry is managed by several key state bodies.

Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources (MENR): This is the primary governmental ministry responsible for setting state policy regarding environmental protection, the use of natural resources, and ecological safety. It serves as the highest-level authority for the sector.   

State Agency for the Use of Mineral Resources: Established in 2018 as a body under the MENR, this agency is the main executive and regulatory authority for the mining sector. Its responsibilities include implementing state policy, managing the state fund and cadastre of mineral deposits, registering geological study activities, and issuing the necessary permits and concessions for mineral extraction.   

The Law on Subsoil (1998): This is the foundational legislation that governs all relations concerning the study, use, and protection of the subsoil and its mineral resources within the territory of Azerbaijan. A key provision of this law is the "mining allotment," which is the formal permit that grants a company the legal right to extract mineral resources from a specified area. The issuance of this allotment is a critical step in the licensing process for any mining operation.   

6.2 Attracting Investment: PSAs, Auctions, and State Partnerships
Azerbaijan employs a multi-faceted approach to attract investment into its mining sector, offering different models tailored to the nature of the project and the investor.

Production Sharing Agreements (PSAs): This model, borrowed from the country's highly successful oil and gas industry, provides a comprehensive and long-term contractual framework that defines the rights and obligations of the investor and the state. It offers clear fiscal terms, tax exemptions on imports and exports, and a stable operating environment. The PSA model has been successfully used for Anglo Asian Mining's operations, providing the security needed for a major international public company to invest.   

Auctions: As part of its modernizing agenda, the State Agency for the Use of Mineral Resources has begun to offer exploration and mining rights for certain mineral deposits through a public auction process. This mechanism is designed to create a transparent and competitive environment, attracting a wider range of potential domestic and international investors.   

Joint Ventures: For projects of major strategic importance, the government has utilized a joint venture model. This approach combines state-owned assets and resources (often held by a state enterprise like AzerGold) with foreign capital, technology, and operational expertise. The partnership between Dashkasan Iron Ore LLC and Kazakhstan's Fonte GreenMet Investments for the development of the HBI plant is a prime example of this model being used to finance and de-risk a large-scale, capital-intensive industrial project.
