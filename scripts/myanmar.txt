An Assessment of Myanmar's Mining and Mineral Processing Infrastructure: Assets, Actors, and Strategic Implications
Section 1: Overview of Myanmar's Extractive Industries
Myanmar's extractive sector is a domain of profound contrasts. It is defined by a world-class geological endowment that places it at the center of several critical global mineral supply chains, yet its development is constrained by deep-seated political instability, armed conflict, and a notoriously opaque governance framework. The sector is not a monolithic entity but a fragmented landscape of state-controlled enterprises, powerful military conglomerates, ascendant domestic companies, and influential foreign investors, all operating within a complex and often contested political geography. The military coup of February 2021 marked a significant inflection point, accelerating a strategic realignment of the industry, triggering the withdrawal of Western-aligned capital, and deepening the sector's integration with regional economic powers, most notably the People's Republic of China. This report provides a comprehensive assessment of Myanmar's known mining and mineral processing assets, contextualizing this infrastructure within the intricate interplay of geology, economics, and geopolitics that shapes the nation's resource wealth.

1.1 Geological Endowment and Global Significance
Myanmar's strategic importance in the global minerals market is rooted in its exceptional geological diversity and concentration of high-demand commodities. The nation is a globally significant producer of several key minerals, possessing reserves that are critical to both traditional heavy industries and modern high-technology sectors. The country's mineral wealth is largely a product of its position at the tectonic crossroads of the Indian-Australian and Eurasian plates, which has resulted in extensive mineralization, particularly along major geological features like the Shan-Thai Block and the Western Granite Province.   

The country's standing in specific commodity markets is particularly noteworthy. Myanmar consistently ranks among the top global producers of tin, a metal indispensable for soldering in the electronics industry. In 2019 and 2020, it was the world's third-largest producer, accounting for an estimated 11-14% of total global output and holding approximately 2.3% of the world's reserves. Similarly, it is a leading source of rare earth elements (REEs), particularly the heavy REEs like dysprosium and terbium that are essential for high-performance permanent magnets used in electric vehicles and wind turbines. By 2020, Myanmar had become the third-largest global producer of REEs, contributing around 13% of the world's supply. The nation is also a top-tier producer of antimony, a strategic mineral used in flame retardants and lead-acid batteries, ranking as the fourth-largest producer in 2019.   

Beyond these industrial and strategic metals, Myanmar is famed for its gemstones. The Hpakant region in Kachin State contains the world's largest and most significant deposits of high-quality jadeite jade, accounting for an estimated 90% of global production. The Mogok "Valley of Rubies" is the historical source of the world's finest rubies, and the country also hosts significant deposits of sapphire and other precious stones. Furthermore, Myanmar possesses world-class polymetallic deposits, such as the Bawdwin mine, which holds substantial reserves of lead, zinc, and silver, alongside copper. The country's resource inventory is rounded out by major deposits of copper, tungsten, nickel, coal, and significant offshore natural gas fields, which constitute the state's single largest source of foreign revenue. This rich and varied endowment ensures that despite its internal challenges, Myanmar remains a critical, and often volatile, node in the global resource economy.

1.2 Sector Structure: A Tripartite Power Dynamic
The operational structure of Myanmar's mining sector is a direct reflection of its political economy, characterized by a tripartite arrangement of power and control among the state, the military, and private enterprise (both foreign and domestic). Formally, the sector is governed by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation (MONREC) under the 2015 Mines Law, which unequivocally asserts that the state is the ultimate owner of all mineral resources. However, in practice, this central authority is diffused and often contested.   

First, State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) act as the primary administrative and commercial arms of the government. Entities such as No. 1 Mining Enterprise (for metals) and No. 2 Mining Enterprise (for tin, tungsten, and gold) are the formal license holders for most major projects and enter into production-sharing contracts (PSCs) with private partners. In the gemstone and energy sectors, Myanmar Gems Enterprise (MGE) and Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE) play equivalent roles, though both are notorious for their lack of transparency.   

Second, the Myanmar military, or Tatmadaw, wields immense economic power through its two primary conglomerates: the Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings Ltd. (UMEHL) and the Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC). These entities are not merely passive investors; they are deeply embedded as joint venture partners in many of the country's most lucrative mining operations, including the Monywa copper complex and the Mawchi tungsten mine. This arrangement ensures a substantial off-budget revenue stream for the military, cementing its political and economic dominance.   

Third, private companies form the operational backbone of the sector. This group includes a significant contingent of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), which has become increasingly dominated by Chinese state-owned and private firms like Myanmar Wanbao Mining Copper Ltd. and China Nonferrous Metal Mining Co. (CNMC). Companies from neighboring Thailand, such as Myanmar Pongpipat Co., Ltd., are also key players, particularly in the southern tin belt. This foreign presence operates alongside a growing class of domestic private champions, such as DELCO Ltd. in the tin-tungsten sector and Win Myint Mo Industries in lead-zinc, which have evolved from junior partners to significant operators in their own right. This complex web of SOEs, military-controlled firms, and private investors creates a system where formal licenses issued by Naypyidaw are often less important than the political connections and local power dynamics that govern an asset on the ground.   

1.3 The Post-2021 Inflection Point: Geopolitical Realignment and Economic Strain
The military coup of February 1, 2021, and the subsequent widespread civil conflict and international sanctions represent the most significant contextual factor shaping Myanmar's mining sector today. The coup triggered a severe macroeconomic crisis, with real GDP contracting by an alarming 17.9% in 2021, and caused a dramatic decline in formal employment in the mineral industry. The political turmoil and the imposition of sanctions by Western nations fundamentally altered the risk calculus for international companies, leading to a pronounced strategic realignment.   

Publicly-listed firms from Western-aligned nations found the operating environment untenable. The combination of direct sanctions against military-controlled entities, the difficulty of securing project financing, and immense reputational and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) risks prompted a wave of divestment. The most prominent example is the Bawdwin project, where the Australian-listed operator, Myanmar Metals Ltd., explicitly cited the "insurmountable difficulties of operating its business in Myanmar" post-coup as the reason for selling its controlling 51% stake in the world-class deposit to its local partner. Similarly, PanAust, an Australian-incorporated but Chinese-owned copper and gold producer, ceased all exploration activities in Myanmar after February 2021.   

This withdrawal of Western capital and technical expertise created an "influence vacuum" that has been rapidly filled by actors less susceptible to Western sanctions and more aligned with the Naypyidaw regime. Chinese state-linked and private companies, viewing the situation as a strategic opportunity to secure resources and expand their regional footprint, have deepened their involvement. This dynamic is most evident in the copper and nickel sectors, which are dominated by Chinese joint ventures with military-linked entities. The result is a rapid and perhaps irreversible integration of Myanmar's mineral economy into China's sphere of influence. This shift has profound consequences, transforming Myanmar's mineral assets from purely economic entities into critical pieces in a broader geopolitical competition. It not only impacts the stability and transparency of global supply chains for commodities like tin and REEs but also provides Beijing with significant economic leverage over the military junta, potentially shaping the country's long-term political and economic trajectory.   

Section 2: Base and Ferrous Metal Operations
Myanmar's base and ferrous metal sector forms the industrial backbone of its extractive industries. The country hosts globally significant deposits of copper, lead, zinc, tin, tungsten, and nickel. Operations range from massive, modern open-pit mines developed with foreign capital to historic underground workings that have been exploited for over a century. The control and development of these assets reveal clear geographical and corporate patterns, highlighting distinct spheres of economic influence and reflecting the complex partnership models between the state, the military, and foreign investors.

2.1 Copper
The epicenter of Myanmar's copper production is the Monywa Complex, located in the Sagaing Region. This vast mining district comprises several large, adjacent porphyry copper deposits that are exploited via open-pit methods and processed using modern solvent extraction-electrowinning (SX-EW) technology to produce London Metal Exchange (LME) Grade 'A' copper cathodes. The complex is a prime example of the tripartite partnership model, involving Chinese capital and technology, the Myanmar military's commercial arm, and a state-owned enterprise.   

Letpadaung Mine: This is the largest and most controversial component of the Monywa Complex. It was developed and is operated by Myanmar Wanbao Mining Copper Ltd., a joint venture between the Chinese state-affiliated Wanbao Mining Ltd. (30%), the military-controlled Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings Ltd. (UMEHL, 19%), and the state's No. 1 Mining Enterprise (51%). The project's development has been marred by significant social conflict, including forced land acquisition from dozens of villages, the destruction of religious sites, and violent crackdowns on local protests, leading to widespread human rights concerns.   

Sabetaung & Kyisintaung (S&K) Mines: These are older mines within the complex, previously operated by a Canadian firm, Ivanhoe Mines, before its divestment. They are now operated by Myanmar Yang Tse Copper Ltd., another Chinese-backed entity, under a similar ownership structure involving the state and UMEHL.   

The entire Monywa Complex has been a focal point of political resistance. Following the 2021 coup, operations at both the Letpadaung and S&K mines were halted in February and March of that year due to widespread worker participation in the Civil Disobedience Movement, directly impacting the revenue streams of both the military and its Chinese partners.   

Other copper assets in Myanmar include the Bawdwin Mine in Shan State, which lists copper as a primary commodity alongside lead and zinc, and the Mahar San copper project. Additionally, the Wuntho copper-gold porphyry project, also in the Sagaing Region, was the subject of a planned acquisition by Australia's Myanmar Metals, but the deal was canceled in the wake of the coup, demonstrating the chilling effect of the political crisis on new investment in the sector.   

2.2 Lead, Zinc, and Silver
Myanmar possesses one of the world's premier polymetallic deposits at the historic Bawdwin Mine in Namtu, Shan State. This asset, which was a leading global producer of lead and silver in the early 20th century, remains the centerpiece of the country's lead-zinc-silver sector.   

Bawdwin Mine: The mine contains a probable ore reserve estimated at 18.4 million metric tons, with exceptionally high grades of 6.4% lead, 3.4% zinc, and 169 grams per metric ton of silver. A major redevelopment project was launched by the Bawdwin Joint Venture (BJV), which initially comprised a 51% controlling stake by Australia's Myanmar Metals Ltd., with local partners East Asia Power (Mining) Co. Ltd. (24.5%) and Win Myint Mo Industries Co. Ltd. (WMM, 24.5%). However, following the 2021 coup, Myanmar Metals divested its entire share to WMM, transferring control of this world-class asset to a domestic entity and highlighting the exodus of Western firms. The future of the capital-intensive redevelopment project under this new ownership structure remains uncertain.   

Other significant lead and zinc operations are also concentrated in Shan State, a region with a complex political landscape involving numerous ethnic armed organizations.

Yadanatheingi Project: A lead mine located in Shan State [User List].

Bawsaing Mine: A known lead-zinc-silver mine.   

Longh Keng Zinc Mine: Located in the Langkho District of Shan State, this mine is owned by Cornerstone Resources (an Australian-linked firm) and operated by East Asia Power (Mining) Co. Ltd..   

Mine in Kalaw: Operated by a joint venture between the state's No. 1 Mining Enterprise and GPS Joint Venture Co. Ltd..   

In addition to mining, Myanmar has dedicated processing facilities. The Lashio zinc refinery in Shan State is operated by East Asia Power, while lead refining and smelting capacity exists in the Yangon Region at facilities run by Myanmar Smelting & Refining Co. Ltd. (MYSARCO) and Yangon Metal Industry Co. Ltd..   

2.3 Tin and Tungsten
Myanmar's tin and tungsten production is geographically concentrated in a belt that runs through the country's eastern and southern regions, forming the northern extension of the vast 3,500 km long Southeast Asian Tin Belt that stretches through Thailand and Malaysia to Indonesia. This region, particularly the Tanintharyi Region and Kayah State, is characterized by a dense network of lode and alluvial deposits that have been mined since the colonial era.   

Mawchi Mine (Kayah State): Historically, this was one of the world's most important sources of tungsten and a significant tin producer. The deposit consists of a cassiterite-wolframite-scheelite bearing quartz lode system hosted within a granite pluton. The operational environment at Mawchi is exceptionally complex, involving a partnership between the state's No. 2 Mining Enterprise, the military's UMEHL, and the Kayah State Mineral Production Co.. The area has a long history of armed conflict, and mining operations have been linked to significant environmental degradation and social strife.   

Kanbauk Mine (Tanintharyi Region): Located in Dawei District, this is one of the nation's largest and most significant tin-tungsten mines. It is operated by DELCO Ltd. (Developers Entrepreneurs Liaison Construction Organizers), which is profiled as Myanmar's largest privately-owned mining company. The mine has been operational for over a century and is a major producer for export.   

Heinda Mine (Tanintharyi Region): This is a major tin mine operated by Myanmar Pongpipat Co. Ltd., a joint venture between Thai investors (65%) and the state's No. 2 Mining Enterprise (35%).   

Dawei (Tavoy) and Myeik (Mergui) Districts: This area in the Tanintharyi Region is home to a dense cluster of dozens of historic and currently active tin and tungsten mines. Notable sites from the user's initial list and other sources include the Hermyingyi Mine, Pagaye Mine, Heinze Basin, Kyaukanya Mine, and Thabawleik Mine. Many of these were originally developed by British colonial firms like the Tavoy Tin Dredging Co. and Consolidated Tin Mines of Burma, and are now operated by a patchwork of local companies and joint ventures.   

The distinct corporate structures in this sector—from the military-state control at Mawchi to the domestic private champion at Kanbauk and the Thai joint venture at Heinda—illustrate the diverse operating models that coexist within this commodity group.

2.4 Nickel and Iron Ore
Myanmar's nickel and iron ore sectors are dominated by large-scale projects backed by Chinese state-owned enterprises and the Myanmar military, reflecting a strategic focus on securing industrial raw materials.

Tagaung Taung Nickel Project (Mandalay/Sagaing Regions): This is the country's flagship nickel project, comprising a laterite ore mine and a ferronickel smelter. The project is operated by Myanmar CNMC Nickel Co., Ltd., which is majority-owned by the state-run China Nonferrous Metal Mining (Group) Co. Ltd. (CNMC), under a production-sharing contract with the government's Mining Enterprise No. 3. The plant has a capacity to produce 85,000 metric tons per year of ferronickel granules, a key ingredient in stainless steel production. The location spans the Htee Gyaint and Thabeikkyin townships.   

MEC Pinpet Mine (Shan State): This is an iron ore project located near Pang Pet, operated directly by the military's Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) [User List]. The deposit is also reported to contain secondary commodities of copper and uranium, making it a potentially strategic asset for the military.   

Mwe Taung Nickel Project: Another nickel deposit has been identified at this location, though detailed operational information is limited.   

The structure of these projects reveals a clear pattern. Large, capital-intensive industrial metal projects that require significant investment in both mining and processing infrastructure, such as Tagaung Taung, are developed through symbiotic partnerships between powerful Chinese SOEs and Myanmar's military conglomerates. The military provides political security and access to the resource, while the Chinese partner provides the capital, technology, and a market for the final product. This model effectively secures the supply chain for China and a revenue stream for the military, while marginalizing other potential investors.

Section 3: Precious Metals and Gemstone Mining
Myanmar's precious metals and gemstone sector is the source of its most iconic and valuable exports, including world-renowned rubies and jade. This sector operates under a fundamentally different governance model than the bulk base metal industry. Characterized by extreme opacity, a weak formal regulatory presence, and the deep involvement of military elites and non-state armed groups, the extraction and trade of these high-value commodities are intrinsically linked to the country's long-standing civil conflicts. Control over the physical territory of the mines is often more critical than formal licensing, making this sector a major source of off-budget financing for various armed actors.

3.1 Gold
Gold mining in Myanmar encompasses a range of operations, from large-scale, formally licensed projects to a vast number of smaller, often informal, mines. The state maintains tight control over the revenue-sharing agreements, which can lead to disputes with operators.

Kyauk Pa Hto Gold Mining Project: Located in Ban Bwe Kon Village, Kawlin Township, Sagaing Division, this is a significant large-scale domestic operation. The facility includes a processing plant with a capacity of 1,000 tons per day, utilizing a cyanidation process (including Carbon-in-Pulp and heap leach methods) to produce refined gold from sulphide and oxidized ores.   

Moehti Moemi Gold Mine: Situated in the Yamethin area of the Mandalay Region, this mine was operated by National Prosperity Gold Production Group Ltd. In a high-profile case, the company's mining permit was revoked by the government in 2018 after it failed to make its contractually obligated payments of 114 kilograms of gold per month to the state, underscoring the government's strict enforcement of its production-sharing terms.   

Foreign interest in Myanmar's gold sector exists, with Russia's Nobel Gold Limited holding an exploration permit for gold and associated minerals. Newer domestic companies, such as Suvannabhūmi Mining & Mineral, are also actively involved, listing gold dore bars and ore as key export products targeted at Asian markets.   

3.2 Jade
Myanmar is the undisputed global center for the mining of jadeite, the more valuable of the two minerals known as jade. A single region in the country's north accounts for the vast majority of the world's supply of high-quality material, making it a resource of immense strategic and economic importance.

Primary Location - The "Jade Tract": The heart of the industry is a specific geographical area in Kachin State known as the "Jade Tract," located primarily within Lonkin and Hpakant Townships. The mining is concentrated along the alluvial region of the Uyu River.   

Specific Mines: Within the Hpakant-Tawmaw Jade Tract, several key mines are operational, including Phakant-gyi, Maw Sisa, Tin Tin, and Khansee. More detailed geological databases list numerous other specific sites, such as Sankhar Mine, Khy-Siu mine, Lonkin, and the historically significant Tawmaw dyke. The Khansee mine is also uniquely identified as the world's only source of Maw Sit Sit, a rare and valuable chrome-rich jade-related rock.   

Secondary Locations: While Hpakant is dominant, notable jade mining also occurs in the neighboring Sagaing Region, particularly in the Hkamti District around the towns of Nasibon and Natmaw.   

The governance of the jade sector is notoriously poor, ranking among the worst-governed resource sectors globally. The industry is characterized by a lack of transparency in licensing, ownership, and revenue flows. The state-owned Myanmar Gems Enterprise (MGE) officially presides over the sector but is highly opaque and ineffective. In reality, the trade has long been a major source of funding for the conflict between the Tatmadaw and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), with both sides taxing or directly controlling mining operations in the territories they hold. The jade trade is therefore not merely an economic activity but a political-economic ecosystem that fuels and sustains one of Myanmar's most protracted ethnic conflicts.   

3.3 Rubies and Sapphires
Myanmar is the historical source of the world's finest and most valuable rubies, with the "Pigeon's Blood" red from the Mogok Valley setting the global standard for quality. Like the jade sector, ruby mining is a high-value industry with a long history intertwined with local power structures.

Mogok (Mandalay Region): Known as the "Valley of Rubies," this legendary mining district has been producing exceptional quality rubies for over a millennium. The primary deposits are hosted in metamorphic marble, and the unique geological conditions, including high chromium content, impart the stones with their characteristic vibrant red color and strong fluorescence.   

Mongshu (Shan State): Emerging as a major new source in the 1990s, Mongshu is now the primary producer of Burmese rubies by volume. The geology of Mongshu is different from Mogok, with rubies often found in alluvial deposits. Mongshu stones typically have a darker, slightly purplish core and almost always require heat treatment to improve their color and clarity, making them generally distinguishable from and less valuable than untreated Mogok rubies.   

Minor Sources: Several smaller ruby and sapphire deposits are scattered across the country. These include Nawarat/Pyinlon near Namkhan in Shan State; Tanai, Nayaseik, and Katpana in Kachin State; and the Sagyin and Yatkanzin stone tracts near Mandalay.   

The physical characteristics of gemstones—their high value-to-weight ratio—make them exceptionally easy to smuggle and difficult to trace. This inherent feature has shaped the governance of the sector, enabling a pervasive shadow economy. Formal state structures like the MGE struggle to exert meaningful control, while real power resides with those who control the mining territories on the ground. This includes local military commands, their business cronies, and, in some areas, Ethnic Armed Organizations. Consequently, the gemstone sector functions as a vast, off-budget financial engine for various armed actors, making any attempts at formal regulation or responsible sourcing exceedingly difficult without addressing the underlying political economy of the conflict that the trade sustains.

Section 4: Energy and Strategic Minerals
This section covers commodities that are of critical importance to both Myanmar's domestic energy security and the global high-technology and defense industries. The governance and operational models for these resources are starkly divided. The natural gas sector is a highly formalized, capital-intensive industry that provides direct, on-budget revenue to the central state. In contrast, the rapidly expanding rare earth element sector operates as a largely informal, unregulated industry in contested territories, with revenues captured primarily by non-state actors. This division highlights the fragmented nature of state control and the varying ways in which Myanmar's resources are integrated into the global economy.

4.1 Coal
Coal mining in Myanmar primarily serves the domestic market, providing fuel for power generation and industries like cement manufacturing. While not as prominent internationally as the country's other resources, it is a key component of the national energy mix.

Tigyit Coal Mine (Shan State): One of the country's most significant coal mines. It has been operated by private entities, including the Eden Group, in partnership with the state.   

Paluzawa Coal Mine (Sagaing Region): Located in the Kalewa area, this mine is operated as a joint venture between Tun Thwin Mining Co. Ltd. and the state's No. 1 Mining Enterprise.   

Other Mines: Numerous other coal deposits are actively mined across the country. These include the Ban Chaung Coal Mine in the Tanintharyi Region, and mines at Dathwegyauk, Namma, Samlaung, Mai Khot, Kaing, and Loije (Lweje) in various other regions [User List]. Large-scale coal mining permits are also held by the military-affiliated Myanmar Economic Corporation and a private company, May Flower Mining Enterprise Co., Ltd..   

4.2 Rare Earth Elements (REEs)
In the years following the 2021 coup, Myanmar has emerged as one of the world's most important sources of heavy rare earth elements (HREEs), such as dysprosium and terbium, which are indispensable for the permanent magnets used in electric vehicles, wind turbines, and advanced defense systems. This boom has been driven almost exclusively by demand from neighboring China.   

Location: The mining is heavily concentrated in remote, mountainous areas of Kachin State near the Chinese border, particularly in Chipwi, Pang War, and Momauk townships.   

Operations: The sector is described as "largely unregulated" and is characterized by environmentally destructive in-situ leaching mining methods. This process involves pumping chemical solutions into the ground to dissolve the REE-bearing clays, leading to widespread deforestation, soil erosion, and the contamination of rivers and groundwater with toxic heavy metals. The scale of the expansion has been explosive; the number of active mining sites in Kachin State reportedly grew from approximately 130 in 2020 to nearly 400 by the end of 2024.   

Governance and Control: The collapse of state authority in these border regions post-coup created a power vacuum. The Kachin Independence Army (KIA), an ethnic armed organization fighting the junta, has seized control of the main REE mining zones from junta-aligned militias. The KIA now functions as the de facto governing authority, managing the taxation of the mining operations and controlling the export of all REE materials to China.   

This situation is a textbook example of a conflict resource rush. China's strategic need to secure a supply of HREEs, while simultaneously offshoring the most environmentally damaging stages of their extraction, converged with the post-coup power vacuum in Kachin. The KIA, seeking revenue to fund its insurgency, stepped in to control and profit from this trade. This has fundamentally altered the dynamics of the civil war, transforming the KIA into a resource-rich, state-like actor that negotiates directly with a global superpower over resources that are critical to the international green energy transition. The conflict in Kachin is no longer just a local insurgency; it is a matter of global strategic importance.

4.3 Antimony
Myanmar is a significant global producer of antimony, a critical mineral used in flame retardants, alloys, and munitions.   

Mines: The primary known operation is the Tha Byu Mine in Kayin State, which is operated by the Tha Byu Mining Co. Ltd., part of the domestic Star Sapphire Group.   

Refineries: Processing facilities are located in the Mawlamyine Industrial Zone in Mon State. Two refineries are noted: one operated by Myanmar Shin Shin Metal Antimony Co. and another by Northeast Sin Phyu Taw Mineral Exploration Co..   

Exports: The newly established domestic firm Suvannabhūmi Mining & Mineral also identifies antimony, in both ore and ingot form, as one of its key export products.   

4.4 Petroleum and Natural Gas
The oil and gas sector is the single most important source of legal foreign revenue for the Myanmar state, making it a focal point of the country's economy and a primary target for international sanctions aimed at restricting the junta's finances. The sector is dominated by the state-owned Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE).   

Offshore Gas Projects: The majority of revenue comes from four major offshore natural gas projects, which export most of their production via pipeline to Thailand and China. These projects are:   

Yadana Project (Andaman Sea): Historically operated by a consortium led by TotalEnergies of France and Chevron of the United States. Both companies have since withdrawn from Myanmar following the coup.   

Yetagun Project (Gulf of Martaban): Operated by a consortium including Petronas of Malaysia and PTTEP of Thailand.   

Zawtika Project (Gulf of Martaban): Operated by Thailand's PTTEP.   

Shwe Project (Bay of Bengal): Located off the coast of Rakhine State and operated by a consortium led by POSCO of South Korea. This project exclusively supplies natural gas to China via a major overland pipeline.   

Refineries and Petrochemical Facilities: Myanmar has limited domestic refining capacity, leading to a high dependency on imported refined fuels. The existing state-owned facilities are aging and include the No. 1 refinery at Thanlyin (near Yangon), the No. 2 refinery at Chauk, and a petrochemical complex at Thanbayarkan in the Magway Region. Plans for a new, modern refinery with a larger capacity near the Chauk facility have been announced.   

Section 5: Industrial Minerals and Processing Facilities
While less prominent on the international stage than metals and gemstones, Myanmar's industrial minerals sector is a vital component of its domestic economy. This sector provides the essential raw materials for construction, infrastructure development, and local manufacturing. The ownership landscape is diverse, involving foreign joint ventures, large domestic conglomerates, and state- and military-owned enterprises, reflecting the foundational importance of these commodities to the national economy.

5.1 Cement Production
Cement production is a key indicator of domestic construction activity. Myanmar has a significant number of cement plants distributed across the country, with operational clusters in regions with abundant limestone reserves, such as the Mandalay Region, Kayin State, and Mon State.

Foreign and Joint Venture Operations: Several major international cement producers have invested in Myanmar.

Mawlamyine Cement Ltd.: A joint venture between Thailand's Siam Cement Group (70%) and Pacific Link Cement Industries (30%), operating a plant in Kyaikmayaw, Mon State. This plant reportedly closed in mid-2020 due to shortages of limestone raw material.   

Myanmar Conch Cement Co. Ltd.: A partnership between China's Anhui Conch Cement Co. Ltd. and the local Myint Investment Group, operating the large No. 33 cement plant in Kyaukse, Mandalay Region.   

Tiger Head Cement (Myanmar): Operates a plant in the key cement production hub of Kyaukse.   

Domestic Private Operations: Large local conglomerates are major players in the cement market.

Shwe Taung Cement Co. Ltd. (STC): A subsidiary of the Shwe Taung Group, operates the Apache cement plant in Pyin Nyaung, Mandalay Region.   

Max Myanmar Manufacturing Co. Ltd.: Part of the Max Myanmar Holding group, operates the Max cement plant in Leiway Township, Nay Pyi Taw Region, and has also operated a leased plant in Tharzi.   

Other notable domestic producers include AAA Cement International Co. Ltd. and Dragon Cement Co. Ltd..   

State and Military-Owned Plants: The military and state retain a significant presence in the sector.

Myanmar Economic Corp. Co. Ltd.: Operates the No. 1 and No. 2 Myaingglay cement plants in Hpa An, Kayin State.   

No. 31 and No. 32 Heavy Industry: These state-owned enterprises operate cement plants in Thayet (Magway Region) and Kyangin (Ayeyarwady Region), respectively.   

Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings Ltd. (UMEHL): The military conglomerate has ownership stakes in several plants, including the Sinminn 3 cement plant in Kyaukse.   

The extensive involvement of military-owned enterprises in a foundational domestic industry like cement demonstrates that the Tatmadaw's economic interests are not confined to high-value export commodities but are deeply integrated into the country's core industrial base.

5.2 Other Industrial Minerals
In addition to the raw materials for cement, Myanmar produces a variety of other industrial minerals to support its economy.

Marble: Vietnam's Simco Song Da Joint Stock Co. holds a Foreign Direct Investment permit for large-scale marble quarrying. The state's No. 3 Heavy Industry also operates marble projects, indicating state involvement in the dimension stone industry.   

Limestone: Beyond its use for cement, limestone is quarried for construction aggregates and other industrial purposes. Good Brother Machinery Co., Ltd. is listed as a large-scale limestone mining enterprise.   

Other Minerals: The country also produces barite, fluorspar, and gypsum, though specific large-scale operations for these are not as well-documented as for other commodities. Production levels for these minerals can be volatile, suggesting they are often extracted from smaller or intermittent operations.   

Section 6: Key Corporate Actors and Foreign Investment
The corporate landscape of Myanmar's mining sector is a complex ecosystem of state-controlled entities, military conglomerates, emerging domestic private companies, and a shifting array of foreign investors. Understanding these actors and their interrelationships is crucial to comprehending the flow of capital, technology, and revenue within the industry. The post-2021 political crisis has significantly reshaped this landscape, accelerating a pivot away from Western engagement and towards deeper reliance on regional, particularly Chinese, investment.

6.1 State and Military-Owned Enterprises
These entities function as the gatekeepers of the formal mining sector, controlling access to resources and acting as mandatory partners in many of the country's most significant projects.

Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings Ltd. (UMEHL): One of the two major conglomerates controlled by the Myanmar military. UMEHL holds significant equity in highly profitable joint ventures, including the Monywa copper complex and the Mawchi tin-tungsten mine. It has been a primary target of international sanctions due to its role in financing the Tatmadaw.   

Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC): The second major military-controlled conglomerate, with direct operational control over assets like the Pinpet iron ore mine and significant interests in the domestic cement industry.   

No. 1 and No. 2 Mining Enterprises: These are the principal civilian SOEs under MONREC. They formally hold the mineral rights for most metal deposits and enter into production-sharing contracts or joint ventures with private operators. They were the state partners in the Bawdwin, Monywa, and Mawchi projects, among others.   

Myanmar Gems Enterprise (MGE) and Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE): These are the specialized SOEs for the gemstone and hydrocarbon sectors, respectively. Both have been heavily criticized for a lack of transparency, with MGE ranking as one of the most opaque state-owned mining companies in the world. MOGE remains the junta's largest single source of foreign currency.   

6.2 Domestic Private Champions
A class of increasingly sophisticated private Myanmar companies has emerged, transitioning from the role of simple local facilitators to capable operators and asset owners.

DELCO Ltd. (Developers Entrepreneurs Liaison Construction Organizers): Profiled as Myanmar's largest privately-owned mining company, DELCO operates the major Kanbauk tin-tungsten mine in the Tanintharyi Region. The company has expressed ambitions to become an international player and has invested in modern technology and exploration.   

Suvannabhūmi Mining & Mineral Co., Ltd.: A newer company established in 2024, positioning itself as a modern, ESG-conscious exporter of gold, antimony, lead, and copper. Its business model focuses on licensed extraction, local processing partnerships, and exporting primarily to China, Thailand, and other Asian markets.   

Win Myint Mo Industries Co. Ltd. (WMM): Originally a junior partner in the Bawdwin project, WMM became the majority owner and de facto operator of the world-class deposit after acquiring the 51% stake from Australia's Myanmar Metals post-coup. This represents a significant transfer of a strategic asset to a domestic entity.   

6.3 Foreign Investment Landscape: The Dominance of China
The foreign investment landscape has undergone a profound transformation. While previously characterized by a mix of investors from Asia, Australia, and North America, the sector is now overwhelmingly dominated by Chinese entities, with a secondary role played by other regional neighbors like Thailand.

Chinese Entities: Chinese state-owned and private companies are the most significant foreign actors, particularly in large-scale base metal projects. Key players include Wanbao Mining Ltd. and Myanmar Yang Tse Copper Ltd. at the Monywa copper complex, and China Nonferrous Metal Mining Co. (CNMC) at the Tagaung Taung nickel project. Chinese firms are also major investors in cement (Anhui Conch) and hold numerous exploration permits.   

Thai Entities: Investment from Thailand is geographically focused on the southern regions bordering Thailand. Myanmar Pongpipat Co. Ltd. is the operator of the Heinda tin mine, and the Siam Cement Group was a major investor in the cement sector.   

Western Divestment: The post-coup era is defined by the exit of Western-aligned companies. This includes the complete divestment of Myanmar Metals Ltd. (Australia) from the Bawdwin project and the announced withdrawal of Valentis Group (Australia-linked). Even companies providing services, such as the global consultancy Knight Piesold, have significantly wound down their operations in the country. This trend has solidified the dominance of investors who are not constrained by Western sanctions regimes.

Section 7: Strategic Outlook and Salient Risks
Myanmar's mining sector stands at a critical juncture. While its geological potential remains undeniably world-class, the sector's future trajectory is clouded by profound and interconnected risks stemming from the country's ongoing political crisis. The operating environment is characterized by extreme volatility, a fractured governance landscape, and severe ESG challenges. For any stakeholder—from investors and commodity traders to downstream manufacturers and policymakers—a nuanced understanding of these risks is paramount. The sector is no longer simply an economic domain but a central arena in the nation's civil conflict, with direct implications for global supply chains and regional geopolitics.

7.1 Future Trajectory: A Sector Under Duress
The analysis of Myanmar's mining assets and corporate actors suggests a future defined by increasing divergence and fragmentation. The sector is likely to evolve along two distinct and parallel paths:

The Formal, Politically-Connected Sector: In areas firmly under the control of the military junta, large-scale, capital-intensive projects will likely continue, albeit with a narrower base of participants. These operations, such as the Monywa copper complex and the Tagaung Taung nickel project, will be dominated by partnerships between military conglomerates (UMEHL/MEC) and Chinese state-owned enterprises. This model provides a symbiotic relationship: the military offers political protection and resource access, while Chinese partners provide sanctions-proof capital, technology, and a guaranteed market. However, the development of new, large-scale projects requiring Western technology and finance, such as the full redevelopment of the Bawdwin mine, will likely remain stalled indefinitely absent a fundamental resolution to the political crisis.

The Informal, Conflict-Driven Sector: In contested territories, particularly the ethnic states bordering China and Thailand, the trend of unregulated, conflict-driven resource extraction is set to intensify. This is most evident in the rare earth and gemstone sectors. The high value-to-weight ratio of these commodities makes them ideal for illicit trade and financing armed groups. The rise of the Kachin Independence Army as the de facto regulator of the strategically vital heavy REE trade is a potent example of this trend. In these regions, formal state laws are irrelevant, and control is exercised by the dominant local armed actor, who captures the resource revenues to fund their political and military objectives.   

7.2 Analysis of Critical Operational Risks
Operating in or sourcing from Myanmar's mining sector entails exposure to some of the most severe risks in the global resource industry.

Political and Regulatory Risk: This is the preeminent risk. The country is in a state of civil war, with the central government's authority contested across large swathes of its territory. There is no stable, predictable, or transparent regulatory framework. The formal legal system, including the 2015 Mines Law and associated environmental regulations, is functionally broken. The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process is plagued by a lack of capacity and political will, with very few projects receiving full approval, leaving operators in a state of legal limbo. On the ground, the rules are often dictated not by Naypyidaw but by local military commanders or ethnic armed group leaders.   

ESG and Reputational Risk: The ESG risks associated with the sector are extreme. There is extensive documentation of human rights abuses linked to mining projects, particularly forced displacement and the violent suppression of protests at sites like the Letpadaung copper mine. Environmental devastation is rampant, especially in the unregulated REE and jade sectors, which cause widespread deforestation, water pollution, and landslides. Crucially, any engagement with the formal sector, particularly through joint ventures with SOEs or military firms, entails a high risk of directly or indirectly financing a military regime that stands accused of crimes against humanity and is subject to extensive international sanctions. This makes "responsible sourcing" from Myanmar exceptionally challenging, if not impossible, for many key commodities.   

Supply Chain and Logistical Risk: The physical logistics of moving equipment and products in Myanmar are fraught with difficulty. Infrastructure is underdeveloped, and transportation routes are frequently disrupted by armed conflict, roadblocks, or protests. Furthermore, supply chains are vulnerable to sudden policy shifts. The decision by Chinese authorities to temporarily close border gates to REE exports from KIA-controlled territory demonstrates how external political factors can instantly sever critical trade routes, creating immense uncertainty for producers and buyers alike.   

7.3 Concluding Assessment for Stakeholders
In conclusion, Myanmar's mining sector presents a stark paradox. It holds immense geological wealth that is critical to global industries, yet accessing this wealth requires navigating an operating environment of unparalleled risk. The post-2021 landscape is one of increasing Chinese and military dominance in the formal sector and a chaotic, conflict-driven resource scramble in contested borderlands.

For potential investors, the barriers to entry are formidable, and the legal, reputational, and physical security risks are acute. For downstream industries and global manufacturers that rely on Myanmar's mineral outputs—from tin in smartphones to REEs in electric vehicles—the key challenge is the profound ethical and supply chain dilemma. Securing these critical raw materials from Myanmar is increasingly tied to the severe ESG and geopolitical consequences of their extraction. The sector cannot be viewed in isolation; it is a primary driver and a central battleground of the country's deep-rooted political and armed conflicts, and its future will be determined not in corporate boardrooms, but by the outcome of the struggle for Myanmar itself.
