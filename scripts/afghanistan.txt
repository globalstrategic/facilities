Afghanistan's Mineral Sector: A Comprehensive Inventory of Extraction and Processing Assets
Executive Summary
Afghanistan's geology is endowed with world-class mineral resources, with estimates of their total value ranging from $1 trillion to over $3 trillion. Confirmed by extensive geological surveys conducted over decades, primarily by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Soviet geologists, these resources include vast deposits of copper, iron, gold, lithium, rare earth elements (REEs), coal, and precious stones. This immense geological potential, however, is starkly contrasted by the operational reality of the country's extractive sector. The industry is defined by a profound disconnect between potential wealth and tangible output, characterized by a handful of stalled mega-projects, a dominant and largely unregulated artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) sector, and a nascent, fragmented processing infrastructure.   

This report provides a comprehensive inventory of Afghanistan's known mining and mineral processing assets, synthesizing historical geological data with contemporary commercial and political intelligence. The analysis reveals that the country's most valuable and internationally recognized assets—the Aynak copper project and the Hajigak iron ore deposit—remain paralyzed by a combination of security risks, insurmountable infrastructure deficits, commercially unviable legacy contract terms, and political instability. These projects, once heralded as the foundation of Afghanistan's economic self-sufficiency, have generated negligible revenue and remain largely undeveloped decades after their initial tendering.   

In contrast, the bulk of current mineral extraction and economic activity is driven by the ASM sector, which exploits a wide range of commodities from gemstones and gold to coal and chromite. Since August 2021, the de facto governing authorities have shifted strategic focus from attracting large, Western-backed consortia to formalizing and taxing this pre-existing informal economy. This is evidenced by the issuance of over 200 small-to-medium scale mining contracts, primarily to domestic and regional companies. This strategy represents a pragmatic attempt at revenue capture in an environment isolated from the global financial system.   

The strategic outlook for the sector is one of incremental, regionally-oriented development rather than large-scale transformation. While major Western investment remains improbable due to sanctions, political risk, and reputational concerns, a new set of actors from China, Iran, Turkey, Qatar, and Central Asian states are engaging through smaller, more manageable contracts. The development of a domestic processing industry, exemplified by the recent establishment of several new cement plants and a small-scale copper smelter, points to a nascent but critical trend towards value-addition within the country. The trajectory of Afghanistan's mineral sector will therefore be a key barometer of the current administration's ability to govern effectively, manage complex commercial relationships, and integrate the nation's economy into the broader region.   

Section 1: National Inventory of Mines and Mineral Occurrences
This section provides a comprehensive inventory of Afghanistan's known mineral endowment, compiled from the most authoritative geological surveys available. The data presented forms the foundational reference for understanding the breadth and distribution of the nation's mineral resources.

1.1. Methodology and Data Sources
The inventory presented in this report is a synthesis of several key datasets collected over more than 50 years. The primary and most scientifically rigorous source is the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Open-File Report 02-110, "Mine and mineral occurrences of Afghanistan", published in 2002. This report compiled and verified data from historical literature and geological files to create an inventory of over 1,000 mines, deposits, mineral showings, and pegmatite fields across the country, covering metals, industrial minerals, coal, and peat. This dataset provides the historical, scientific backbone of this report's inventory.   

This foundational data has been cross-referenced and augmented with more recent, albeit often fragmented, provincial mineral occurrence lists published by Afghanistan's Ministry of Mines and Petroleum (MoMP). These lists, while not as systematically detailed as the USGS report, offer a more contemporary view of the government's acknowledged mineral sites on a province-by-province basis.   

Additional details on specific deposits, particularly concerning geology and resource estimates, have been integrated from topical reports produced by organizations such as the British Geological Survey (BGS), which has collaborated extensively with the Afghanistan Geological Survey (AGS) since 2004, and from analyses of historical Soviet-era geological reports.   

A significant challenge in compiling this data is the discrepancy between the age and reliability of different sources. The most comprehensive dataset from the USGS is now over two decades old. While it confirms the geological potential, it offers no insight into the current operational status, accessibility, or security of these sites. Conversely, more recent official data from the MoMP is often difficult to access, with some provincial data pages on its website being inaccessible, and the ministry's online Transparency Portal shows data that raises questions about its accuracy and currency, such as reporting zero revenue for recent years. This creates a significant information risk for any potential investor or analyst. A site cataloged in the 2002 USGS report may have since been illegally mined to exhaustion, be under a new contract that has not been publicly disclosed, or be located in an area with prohibitive security challenges. Therefore, the data presented here represents the most complete public-domain synthesis possible, but on-the-ground verification would be essential for any commercial or policy decision-making.   

1.2. Caveat on Comprehensiveness: The Undocumented Sector
It must be explicitly stated that a truly exhaustive list of every mining operation in Afghanistan is impossible to compile. The official and historical records, upon which this report is based, do not capture the vast, dynamic, and often illicit world of artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM). The ASM sector dominates the country's mining industry in terms of active operations and employment, with thousands of informal sites extracting everything from gold and gemstones to coal and talc. These operations are, by their nature, largely undocumented. The USGS has undertaken efforts to map these activities using high-resolution satellite imagery, providing some insight into their scale and location, but a complete, real-time census remains elusive.   

1.3. Provincial Inventories
The following subsections detail known mineral occurrences, deposits, and mines, organized by each of Afghanistan's 34 provinces.

1.3.1. Badakhshan Province
Badakhshan province, in Afghanistan's mountainous northeast, is historically renowned for its high-quality gemstones, particularly lapis lazuli, which has been mined there for over 6,000 years. The province also hosts one of the country's two primary gold belts, running southwest into Takhar province, and significant reserves of other minerals. The MoMP has identified numerous mineral occurrences, and the region is a major hub for both historical and ongoing ASM activities.

Section 2: Deep-Dive Analysis of Strategic Mineral Projects
While Afghanistan hosts over a thousand documented mineral occurrences, a handful of world-class deposits form the core of its strategic mineral wealth. These "crown jewel" assets have attracted significant international attention and represent the greatest long-term potential for transforming the country's economy. However, their development has been consistently hindered by a complex web of commercial, political, security, and logistical challenges. This section provides a detailed analysis of these key projects.

2.1. The Aynak Copper Project (Logar Province)
The Aynak deposit, located approximately 30 km southeast of Kabul in Logar province, is one of the largest and highest-grade undeveloped copper resources in the world. Its development has long been considered a cornerstone of Afghanistan's economic future, but the project has been stalled for over 15 years.   

Geological Significance: Aynak is a world-class sediment-hosted stratiform copper deposit, a geological style known for large tonnages. Soviet-era surveys, later confirmed by the USGS, estimated resources ranging from 240 million metric tons at a grade of 2.3% copper to as high as 690.8 million metric tons at 1.6% copper. The deposit is characterized by the copper minerals bornite and chalcopyrite hosted within metamorphosed sedimentary rocks. In addition to copper, the deposit also contains valuable quantities of cobalt.   

Contractual History and Chronic Delays: In 2007-2008, during a global commodities super-cycle, the Afghan government awarded a 30-year, approximately $3 billion contract to a Chinese state-owned consortium comprising the Metallurgical Corporation of China (MCC) and Jiangxi Copper Corporation. The terms of the deal were highly ambitious, reflecting the high commodity prices of the era. The consortium committed not only to developing the mine but also to building critical ancillary infrastructure, including a 400 MW coal-fired power plant, a railway line from the mine to the Pakistan border, and a smelter to process the copper ore within Afghanistan.   

However, progress quickly stalled. The project's economics became less favorable as copper prices retreated from their peaks. Furthermore, a series of profound obstacles emerged. A major complication is the location of the copper deposit directly beneath a vast, 2,000-year-old Buddhist monastic complex, one of the most significant archaeological sites in Afghanistan. The need to excavate and preserve thousands of artifacts before mining can begin has caused extensive delays. Persistent security threats in Logar province and disputes over the financial and technical terms of the contract—with the Chinese consortium reportedly seeking to reduce its infrastructure commitments and lower the agreed-upon 19.5% royalty rate—further paralyzed the project.   

Current Status: Following the change of government in 2021, there has been a renewed push to restart the project. A groundbreaking ceremony was reported in July 2024, and in August 2025, the de facto authorities announced a 15-year extension to the contract, bringing the total term to 45 years. Officials have stated that MCC has resumed some preliminary work, such as road construction, and that operational activities are expected to begin soon. Despite these announcements, the fundamental challenges of infrastructure, archaeological preservation, and contract viability remain formidable. The optimistic projection for the mine's opening is 2026, though this timeline remains highly uncertain.   

2.2. The Hajigak Iron Ore Deposit (Bamyan/Wardak Provinces)
The Hajigak deposit, straddling the border of Bamyan and Maidan Wardak provinces in Afghanistan's central highlands, is one of the largest and highest-quality undeveloped iron ore deposits in Asia. Its development could position Afghanistan as a major regional steel producer.   

Geological Significance: Hajigak is a world-class resource, with geological surveys estimating total reserves of 1.8 to 2.2 billion metric tons of ore. The ore is exceptionally high-grade, with an average iron content of 62-69%, making it suitable for direct-shipping ore (DSO) operations. The deposit consists of 16 distinct ore bodies stretching over a 32 km area and is amenable to open-pit mining. The ore also contains traces of niobium, a valuable element used in high-strength steel alloys.   

Contractual History and Failure: In 2011, the Afghan government awarded mining rights for four blocks of the deposit. Three blocks were awarded to a consortium of seven Indian companies led by the Steel Authority of India Ltd. (SAIL), and the fourth block was awarded to Canada's Kilo Goldmines. The Indian consortium's ambitious $11 billion proposal included the construction of a steel plant, a power plant, and supporting infrastructure. However, the contract was never finalized and the project collapsed. The failure was attributed to the deteriorating security situation, the immense logistical challenges of operating in a remote, mountainous region without rail or adequate road infrastructure, and the Indian consortium's concerns about the project's commercial viability after the global decline in iron ore prices.   

Current Status: The Hajigak deposit remains undeveloped, officially in a "Proposed" status. The project exemplifies the "mega-project paralysis" that has afflicted Afghanistan's largest resources. The sheer scale of the required investment in both the mine and the necessary transportation infrastructure (a dedicated railway to a port is essential for bulk commodity export) has proven to be beyond the capacity or risk appetite of foreign state-backed consortia. However, a new development model may be emerging. In May 2025, it was reported that a consortium of domestic Afghan investors had pledged a $650 million investment for a phased development of a section of the mine, in collaboration with an unnamed foreign technical partner. This plan includes the establishment of a plant to process 9,000 tons of sponge iron daily, targeting the domestic market and aiming to create 6,000 jobs. This shift towards domestic capital and a more phased, locally-focused approach may represent a more realistic path forward, though it still faces immense logistical hurdles.   

2.3. Primary Gold Belts (Badakhshan-Takhar and Ghazni-Zabul)
Afghanistan has two main gold belts that have been centers of both historical mining and modern exploration. The development of these resources has been characterized by small-to-medium-scale contracts often plagued by governance issues and illegal extraction.   

Overview: The northeastern belt runs from Badakhshan southwest to Takhar province and is dominated by placer (alluvial) and paleoplacer deposits, which have been the focus of artisanal mining for centuries. The southwestern belt runs from Ghazni to Zabul province and includes significant lode gold and porphyry-style deposits.   

Key Deposits & Contracts:

Zarkashan (Ghazni Province): This is a large area of interest containing multiple gold and copper occurrences associated with a porphyry and skarn system. With a mining history stretching back over 2,000 years, it is one of the most significant hard-rock gold deposits in the country. A bankable project was identified covering 484 km2 with an estimated 7.7 tonnes of gold.   

Nuraba and Samti (Takhar Province): These are extensive placer gold deposits. The Samti deposit alone was estimated by Soviet surveys to contain over 30 tonnes of gold. In 2008 and again in 2012, contracts for these mines were awarded to West Land General Trading Company (WLGT), a deal that was later criticized by watchdog groups for alleged irregularities and non-transparent bidding. As of October 2025, the contract for the large Samti gold mine, valued at $110 million, has been awarded to a Chinese company for a five-year term.   

Qara Zaghan (Baghlan Province): In 2011, an exploration license for this gold deposit was awarded to a local company, Afghan Krystal Natural Resources (AKNR). Subsequent investigations by civil society groups alleged that the company engaged in illegal extraction for profit during the exploration phase, in breach of its contract, highlighting the severe governance and monitoring failures that have characterized the sector.   

2.4. Strategic & Critical Minerals: Lithium and Rare Earth Elements (REEs)
Afghanistan's potential reserves of lithium and REEs have garnered significant international attention, particularly in the context of the global energy transition. This has led to descriptions of Afghanistan as a potential "lithium capital of the world".   

Potential and Known Deposits: Surveys have identified prospective areas for lithium in the provinces of Ghazni, Herat, and Nuristan, often associated with pegmatite fields. The Khanneshin carbonatite deposit in southern Helmand province is a major known resource of REEs, including valuable elements like lanthanum and cerium, as well as niobium.   

Current Status: Despite the immense geopolitical and economic interest, particularly from China, which dominates global critical mineral supply chains, these resources remain almost entirely undeveloped. The deposits are at an early exploration or resource-definition stage. The extreme security challenges in provinces like Helmand and Nuristan, combined with the technical complexity and high capital investment required for REE and lithium mining and processing, have so far precluded any serious development. While these minerals represent a significant component of Afghanistan's long-term potential, their path to commercial exploitation is the longest and most uncertain of all the country's strategic assets.   

Section 3: Inventory and Analysis of Mineral Processing Facilities
The ability to process raw minerals into higher-value products is a critical step for economic development, capturing more of the value chain domestically and reducing reliance on exporting low-price raw materials. While Afghanistan's mining sector is dominated by primary extraction, a nascent and growing processing industry exists, particularly in cement production. This section inventories the country's known mineral processing facilities.

3.1. Cement Production
Cement production is Afghanistan's most established and rapidly expanding mineral processing sub-sector, driven by domestic construction needs and a government strategy to achieve self-sufficiency and reduce imports from neighboring countries.   

Ghori Cement Plants (Baghlan Province): The Ghori complex in Pul-e-Khumri is the historical heart of Afghanistan's cement industry.

Ghori I & II: The original Ghori I plant, with a capacity of 400 tons per day (tpd), began operating in 1962. A second plant, Ghori II, with a capacity of 1,000 tpd, was partially constructed in the 1980s but was only completed after 2007. Combined production has fluctuated due to technical issues and high coal prices, but as of July 2024, capacity had reportedly doubled to 700 tpd.   

Ghori III: In September 2025, construction began on a new, modern Ghori III plant with a planned capacity of 5,000 tpd and an investment of $86.7 million, marking a major expansion of the site. Another report from August 2025 noted the inauguration of a new 500 tpd facility in Baghlan, possibly a separate or related project.   

Jabal al-Saraj Cement Plant (Parwan Province): The original state-owned plant had a very small capacity of around 100 tons per year. The site is now undergoing a massive expansion under a $220 million contract awarded to a Qatari-backed company, Al-Falah Global and International Task Group. The project aims to increase capacity to 1.5 million tons per year (ramping up from an initial 3,000 tpd to 9,000 tpd). As of January 2025, 90% of the initial exploration and mineral sampling work was reported as complete, with construction expected to take two years.   

New Projects Under Contract: The post-2021 administration has signed several major contracts to build new cement plants across the country:

Yateem Taq Cement Project (Jawzjan Province): A $163 million, 30-year contract was signed in October 2024 with Turkey's 77 Construction Company. The plant is planned to produce 3,000 tons of cement daily.   

Altamur Cement Project (Logar Province): A $145 million, 30-year contract was signed in December 2024 with a private entity, Afghan Sako.   

Shur Andam Cement Factory (Kandahar Province): A contract was awarded to a private firm in March 2023, and as of February 2025, the factory was reported to be nearing completion and set to open within six months.   

Gulbahar Cement Factory (Herat Province): A $142 million contract was signed with a local firm in October 2023.   

3.2. Metallurgical Processing
Downstream metallurgical processing, such as smelting and refining, is far less developed than cement production. The lack of reliable and large-scale electricity is a primary constraint. However, recent developments indicate a nascent trend towards establishing local smelting capabilities.

Jawzjan Copper Smelter: In a significant development for the sector, a small-scale copper smelting plant was opened in Sheberghan city, Jawzjan province, in September 2025. The facility was established by an Afghan entrepreneur, Asadullah Hosseini, with a private investment of 7 million Afghanis. The plant has a reported capacity to smelt five tonnes of raw copper per day. While minor in global terms, this facility represents a crucial proof-of-concept for private-sector-led, value-added processing within Afghanistan, independent of the stalled mega-projects.   

Aynak Copper Smelter (Proposed): The original 2008 contract with MCC for the Aynak copper mine included a commitment to construct a copper smelter in Afghanistan. This was a key provision intended to ensure that value-addition occurred in-country. This commitment has been a point of contention during the project's long delay but was reportedly reaffirmed as part of the 15-year contract extension granted in August 2025. Its construction remains entirely dependent on the broader development of the Aynak mine itself.   

Steel Production: The USGS has noted that Afghanistan's mineral-processing industry produces steel. However, this production is likely limited to small-scale facilities that melt scrap metal, rather than primary steelmaking from iron ore, which would require the development of a major deposit like Hajigak and a far more extensive industrial infrastructure.   

3.3. Industrial and Dimension Stone Processing
Afghanistan has a long history of processing high-value stones, but the industry remains highly fragmented and largely artisanal.

Talc Processing: A 2020 USGS report noted the existence of 36 talc mines in Kapisa and Nangarhar provinces and 22 associated talc-processing plants in Nangarhar. Critically, the report stated that all 22 processing plants were closed at the time due to a lack of raw material, a direct consequence of government delays in issuing mining licenses. This situation highlights the vulnerability of downstream industries to upstream administrative and regulatory dysfunction.   

Marble, Onyx, and Lapis Lazuli Processing: Afghanistan is renowned for its high-quality dimension stone, such as the pink onyx marble from Nangarhar province. Processing of these materials is widespread but typically occurs in small, often family-owned workshops using basic equipment. There is no comprehensive public inventory of these facilities. The lapis lazuli industry, centered in Badakhshan, follows a similar artisanal model.   

The divergent paths of processing development are notable. Large, state-driven, integrated projects like the Aynak smelter or the major cement plants require immense capital, stable energy supplies, and a predictable political environment—conditions largely absent in Afghanistan, leading to significant delays. In contrast, smaller, private-sector ventures like the Jawzjan smelter demonstrate a more agile model. With lower capital requirements and the ability to serve local or niche markets, these enterprises can navigate the challenging operational environment more effectively. The government's 2025 approval of a new policy to standardize mineral processing and attract investment suggests an official recognition of the need to foster this downstream sector. However, the tangible success of the small Jawzjan smelter versus the perpetually stalled Aynak smelter indicates that the most realistic path to expanding processing capacity may lie in supporting an ecosystem of domestic entrepreneurs rather than relying solely on the activation of mega-projects.

Section 4: The Informal Sector: Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining (ASM)
No inventory of Afghanistan's mineral sector would be complete without a thorough examination of artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM). While official reports and international attention often focus on large-scale projects, the ASM sector constitutes the overwhelming majority of active mining operations, employment, and, until recently, revenue generation in the country. It is both the de facto economic engine of the extractive industry and a primary governance challenge.

4.1. Dominance and Economic Significance
The World Bank and other observers consistently note that Afghanistan's mining sector is "largely undeveloped and dominated by small-scale and low cost mechanized mine operations". For decades, these operations—ranging from individuals panning for gold in rivers to semi-mechanized groups digging for coal with basic tools—have provided a crucial source of livelihood for hundreds of thousands of Afghans, particularly in rural areas with few other economic opportunities. However, this informal economy has historically been a major source of instability. Revenue from ASM has funded warlords, corrupt officials, and insurgent groups, including the Taliban prior to 2021, while contributing negligible amounts to state coffers. This phenomenon has been described as "industrial-scale looting," where minerals were extracted and transported openly with little to no government oversight or payment of royalties.   

4.2. Key ASM Commodities
The ASM sector is active across a wide range of commodities, typically those that are high-value or can be extracted without significant capital investment or advanced technology.

Gemstones: Afghanistan's most famous ASM products are its precious and semi-precious stones. Lapis lazuli from Badakhshan, emeralds from Panjshir, and rubies from Jagdalak have been mined through traditional methods for millennia and continue to be a primary focus of artisanal miners.   

Gold: Placer gold mining is a widespread ASM activity, particularly in the riverbeds and alluvial plains of the northeastern gold belt in Takhar and Badakhshan provinces. Artisans use simple methods like panning and sluicing to recover fine gold from sediments.   

Coal: Much of Afghanistan's coal production comes from small-scale mines, such as those at Kalēch in Bamyan and throughout the northern coal belt. These operations often involve dangerous, manually dug tunnels with minimal safety precautions.   

Chromite and Talc: These industrial minerals are heavily exploited through ASM, particularly in the eastern provinces. Reports from before 2021 indicated that the vast majority of talc mining in Nangarhar, for instance, was controlled by non-state actors.   

4.3. Mapping the Informal Sector
Given the undocumented nature of ASM, traditional survey methods are inadequate. To address this, the USGS has pioneered the use of very high-resolution satellite imagery to identify and catalog active ASM operations. This project creates datasets of 1 km² grid cells, indicating the presence and number of mine sites within each cell. This remote sensing approach provides a modern, data-driven method for estimating the geographic footprint and intensity of the ASM sector, offering a crucial tool for policymakers and analysts trying to understand the true scale of mining activity on the ground.   

4.4. The Post-2021 Formalization Drive
The administration that took power in August 2021, facing international sanctions and the cut-off of foreign aid, has made revenue generation from the mining sector a top economic priority. Recognizing that the quickest path to revenue is to tax existing economic activity, the government has embarked on a large-scale effort to formalize the ASM sector. This has been done through the issuance of at least 205 small- and medium-scale mining contracts since 2021.   

This strategy marks a fundamental shift. Instead of focusing on creating new industries around mega-projects, the primary effort is to bring the sprawling, pre-existing informal mining economy under centralized regulatory control and, most importantly, into the tax base. The administration has reportedly been more effective at collecting royalties and taxes than the previous government and has taken steps to curb illegal mining and smuggling. The success or failure of this formalization drive—and the transparency with which the resulting revenues are managed—will be more indicative of the state's capacity and the sector's near-term economic impact than any developments related to the large, stalled projects.   

Section 5: Operational Environment and Strategic Outlook
The comprehensive inventory of Afghanistan's mineral assets reveals a landscape of immense potential constrained by severe, deeply entrenched challenges. The future trajectory of the sector depends less on the geological endowment, which is proven, and more on the ability of the country's administrators and investors to navigate a uniquely difficult operational environment.

5.1. Foundational Impediments
Two fundamental barriers have historically prevented the large-scale development of Afghanistan's mineral wealth.

Infrastructure Deficit: Afghanistan's rugged, mountainous terrain and lack of modern infrastructure are the single greatest technical impediments to a viable mining industry. The country lacks the extensive railway network necessary for the economic transport of bulk commodities like iron ore and coal to international markets. The power grid is underdeveloped and unreliable, incapable of supporting the massive energy requirements of large-scale mines, processing plants, and smelters. While some progress has been made on road networks, many deposits remain in remote, inaccessible areas.   

Security and Political Risk: Decades of conflict have left a legacy of insecurity and physical hazards, including widespread contamination from landmines and unexploded ordnance, which complicates exploration and development. While the post-2021 administration has established a greater degree of centralized control and reduced internal conflict, the political risks for international investors are immense. The government is not internationally recognized and operates under a strict international sanctions regime, which severely complicates financial transactions, equipment procurement, and product export. Furthermore, the reputational risk for Western companies of engaging with the current administration is exceptionally high.   

5.2. The Evolving Legal and Commercial Landscape
The governance of Afghanistan's mining sector has undergone a significant transformation, moving from a system characterized by decentralized corruption to one of centralized revenue capture.

Pre-2021 Era: The period of the Islamic Republic was described by observers as one of "industrial-scale looting". Although a legal framework for mining existed, it was poorly enforced. Contracts were often awarded based on political connections to powerful individuals, including members of parliament, rather than on technical or financial merit. Companies frequently began extraction during the exploration phase without fulfilling contractual obligations such as conducting environmental and social impact assessments (ESIAs) or paying stipulated royalties and taxes. This resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in lost state revenue annually and entrenched a system where mineral wealth fueled corruption and conflict rather than national development.   

Post-2021 Era: The current administration has prioritized cracking down on corruption and maximizing state revenue from mining. Their approach has focused on reasserting central control over mineral sites, preventing illegal mining, and formalizing the ASM sector through a large number of small-scale contracts. While this has reportedly led to a significant increase in revenue collection, transparency remains a major concern. The details of many new contracts are not publicly disclosed, and in June 2024, Afghanistan was suspended from the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), a global standard for the good governance of oil, gas, and mineral resources, signaling a lack of adherence to international transparency norms.   

5.3. Strategic Outlook and Emerging Trends
The future of Afghanistan's mining sector is being reshaped by the withdrawal of Western influence and the emergence of a new set of economic and political dynamics.

The Pivot to Regional Players: The long-term paralysis of the Western-backed and early Chinese mega-projects has created a vacuum being filled by more risk-tolerant regional and domestic actors. New investments and contracts involve companies from China (in new, often smaller deals), Turkey, Iran, Qatar, and neighboring Central Asian states like Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. These players often have different geopolitical calculations, lower transparency expectations, and a greater willingness to operate within the constraints of the current political environment.   

A Shift to Incrementalism: The "mega-project paralysis" has demonstrated that Afghanistan's most valuable assets may be "too big to succeed" in the current context. Their development is contingent on nation-scale solutions that are not forthcoming. Consequently, the most realistic path for near-term growth lies in the incremental development of smaller, less infrastructure-dependent deposits. This includes high-value, low-volume commodities like gemstones and some precious metals, as well as industrial minerals like coal and cement for the domestic and regional markets.

The Rise of Domestic Processing: The recent flurry of contracts for new cement plants and the establishment of the private copper smelter in Jawzjan are perhaps the most significant positive trends. This move towards domestic value-addition, even on a small scale, is a critical step towards building a more resilient and self-sufficient economy.

In conclusion, the trajectory of Afghanistan's mining sector in the coming years will likely not be defined by the activation of its multi-trillion-dollar potential. Instead, it will be a story of smaller victories: the successful formalization and taxation of another artisanal mine, the completion of a new cement plant that reduces import dependency, and the expansion of small-scale processing facilities. The sector's development will serve as a crucial barometer of the administration's capacity for pragmatic economic governance and its ability to slowly reintegrate Afghanistan into the regional economic fabric, one mine and one factory at a time.
