The Mining and Mineral Processing Landscape of the United Arab Emirates: A Comprehensive National Directory and Sector Analysis
Executive Summary
This report provides a comprehensive analysis and directory of the mining and mineral processing facilities within the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The nation's industrial strategy is defined by a dual-track approach that has positioned it as a significant player in both regional resource extraction and global downstream processing. On one hand, the UAE leverages its substantial geological endowments, particularly within the Hajar Mountains, to support a world-scale quarrying industry. This sector extracts vast quantities of limestone, gabbro, dolomite, and other industrial minerals, making the UAE a leading global exporter of construction aggregates and a key supplier to domestic cement and steel industries. On the other hand, the nation has successfully executed a capital-intensive strategy to develop a world-class downstream processing industry for high-value metals. This includes globally significant aluminium production, a sophisticated steel manufacturing sector, and a major international hub for precious metals refining. This downstream sector is largely dependent on imported raw materials, a reality that has shaped a national industrial policy focused on supply chain security, technological leadership, and value-added manufacturing.

Key findings of this report underscore the dominance of state-affiliated industrial champions, such as Emirates Global Aluminium (EGA) and EMSTEEL, which anchor their respective value chains. The strategic development of integrated industrial zones, notably the Khalifa Economic Zones Abu Dhabi (KEZAD) and the Jebel Ali Free Zone (JAFZA), has been instrumental in creating synergistic ecosystems that attract foreign investment and facilitate efficient logistics. These zones provide critical infrastructure, competitive utility rates, and streamlined regulatory environments that are essential for the success of energy-intensive industries like metals production. Furthermore, an emerging strategic focus on sustainability, decarbonization, and the circular economy is becoming a key competitive differentiator for leading UAE producers, particularly in the steel and aluminium sectors, as they adapt to evolving global market demands and regulatory pressures.

It is critical to address a significant discrepancy present in the initial source data provided for this analysis. The facility listed as "Fujairah Refinery" with primary commodities of copper and gold is, in fact, a hydrocarbon refinery and petroleum storage terminal. This facility has a complex history, having previously operated under the name Metro Refinery and later being fully owned by the Fujairah government before its acquisition by Vitol and, more recently, a consortium led by the trading group Montfort. Its operations are exclusively focused on the blending, storage, and processing of petroleum products such as crude oil, fuel oil, naphtha, and gasoline. There is no evidence to suggest it has ever been involved in the smelting or refining of copper, gold, or any other metals. This clarification is essential for the accuracy of the report, and consequently, the Fujairah oil refinery will not be included in the subsequent detailed analysis of the UAE's mineral and metal processing facilities.   

Chapter 1: The Aluminium Value Chain: A Global Powerhouse
The UAE's aluminium sector represents the nation's most successful and prominent example of state-led industrial diversification beyond hydrocarbons. Through strategic consolidation and massive investment in upstream and downstream capabilities, the country has built a fully integrated industry that is a dominant force in the global market.

1.1. Corporate Profile: Emirates Global Aluminium (EGA)
Emirates Global Aluminium (EGA) is the cornerstone of the UAE's non-oil industrial economy and stands as the largest industrial company in the country outside of the oil and gas sector. Its corporate structure is a clear indicator of its strategic national importance, as it is a state-owned enterprise equally controlled by Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala Investment Company, and the Investment Corporation of Dubai. This direct government ownership ensures robust financial backing and aligns the company's long-term strategy with the UAE's broader economic development and diversification goals.   

The formation of EGA in 2013 was a landmark event in the UAE's industrial history, created through the merger of two pre-existing aluminium giants: Dubai Aluminium (DUBAL), which was founded in 1975, and Emirates Aluminium (EMAL), founded in 2007. This strategic consolidation created a unified national champion, streamlining operations, combining technological expertise, and enhancing global market presence. Today, EGA is the world's largest producer of 'premium aluminium' and accounts for a significant portion of global output, producing one in every 25 tonnes of aluminium made worldwide. The aluminium it produces is the UAE's single largest made-in-the-UAE export after oil and gas, generating billions of dollars in annual revenue and playing a pivotal role in the nation's economic diversification.   

1.2. Upstream Processing: Al Taweelah Alumina Refinery
The Al Taweelah Alumina Refinery is a critical asset in EGA's operational portfolio and a testament to the UAE's strategic industrial planning. Located within the Khalifa Industrial Zone Abu Dhabi (KIZAD) and situated adjacent to the Al Taweelah smelter, it is the first and only alumina refinery in the UAE and only the second in the entire Middle East. The facility, owned and operated by Emirates Global Aluminium (EGA), commenced production in 2019 following a total investment of approximately $3.3 billion.   

The refinery employs the Bayer process to convert bauxite ore into smelter-grade alumina, the essential feedstock for aluminium smelters. It is designed to process over five million tonnes of imported bauxite annually, yielding a production capacity of over two million tonnes of alumina per year. This output is strategically calibrated to meet a substantial portion of EGA's internal demand, supplying between 40% and 50% of the total alumina required by its smelters in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.   

The development of this refinery represents a calculated and transformative strategic shift for EGA and the UAE. The nation possesses no domestic bauxite reserves, meaning that prior to the refinery's commissioning, EGA's smelters were entirely dependent on the global market for their supply of alumina. This 100% import dependency created a significant vulnerability in the supply chain, exposing the nation's most important non-oil industry to international price volatility, shipping disruptions, and geopolitical risks. The decision to invest heavily in the Al Taweelah refinery, in conjunction with EGA's parallel investment in its wholly-owned Guinea Alumina Corporation (GAC) bauxite mine in West Africa, was a deliberate act of strategic backward integration. This move was not merely about constructing a new factory; it was a sophisticated effort to de-risk the aluminium sector by capturing more of the value chain, from mine to metal. By securing a significant portion of its own feedstock, EGA has created a powerful hedge against market fluctuations, reduced its exposure to external supply shocks, and ensured greater operational continuity and cost stability for its core smelting operations.   

1.3. Smelting Operations: Al Taweelah and Jebel Ali Facilities
EGA's primary aluminium production is centered at two mega-smelters, which collectively represent one of the largest single-site aluminium production capacities in the world.

1.3.1. EGA Al Taweelah Smelter (formerly EMAL)
Located in the Khalifa Industrial Zone Abu Dhabi (KIZAD), the Al Taweelah smelter is a colossal industrial facility and the world's largest single-site primary aluminium producer. Operated by EGA, the plant has an annual production capacity of 1.3 million tonnes of aluminium and is supported by its own 3,100 MW power station to meet its immense energy requirements. The sheer scale of the operation is vast, with the site covering an area five times larger than Abu Dhabi's Al Maryah Island. Its strategic location in KIZAD provides seamless access to Khalifa Port for the import of raw materials and export of finished products.   

1.3.2. EGA Jebel Ali Smelter (formerly DUBAL)
The Jebel Ali smelter in Dubai is the UAE's original aluminium production facility, having commenced operations in 1979. Owned and operated by EGA, it has undergone numerous expansions and is now one of the world's largest single-site primary aluminium smelters, with a production capacity of over 1 million tonnes per annum. The complex is located on a 480-hectare site and includes a dedicated 2,974 MW power station and a large desalination plant capable of producing 30 million gallons of water per day. The facility is highly integrated, with on-site carbon plants and extensive storage facilities for raw materials like alumina, calcined petroleum coke, and liquid pitch. The Jebel Ali plant produces a diverse range of high-value aluminium products, including high-purity aluminium for the electronics and aerospace industries, foundry alloys for automotive applications, and extrusion billets for construction and transportation purposes.

Chapter 2: Steel and Ferro-Alloy Manufacturing
The UAE's steel sector is a dynamic and technologically advanced industry, characterized by a strategic focus on modern production methods, a growing emphasis on recycling, and the manufacturing of high-quality, long-product steel primarily for the regional construction market. Unlike the aluminium sector's reliance on imported primary materials, the steel industry leverages both imported direct-reduced iron pellets and a robust domestic scrap metal collection ecosystem.

2.1. Market Leader Profile: EMSTEEL (formerly Emirates Steel Arkan)
EMSTEEL is the UAE's largest publicly listed steel and building materials company, a national industrial champion formed through the strategic merger of Emirates Steel and Arkan Building Materials in late 2021. The entity, which recently rebranded from Emirates Steel Arkan to EMSTEEL, operates as an integrated conglomerate with distinct divisions for steel and building materials.   

The company's Steel Division, located in the Musaffah industrial area of Abu Dhabi, is the only integrated steel plant in the UAE. This state-of-the-art facility has a total annual production capacity of 3.5 million tonnes of steel. Its integrated nature is demonstrated by its comprehensive production line, which includes three Direct Reduction Plants (DRPs) with a combined capacity of 4.2 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) for producing Direct Reduced Iron (DRI), three Steel Making Plants with a capacity of 3.6 mtpa, and a series of advanced rolling mills. The company's product portfolio is focused on high-demand construction materials, including rebar, wire rod, and heavy sections. Notably, EMSTEEL is the only producer of hot-rolled sheet piles in the entire Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, a key competitive distinction.   

The Building Materials Division is anchored by the Al Ain Cement Factory, an integrated plant with an annual capacity of 4.6 million tonnes of cement and 3.1 million tonnes of clinker. This division also manufactures other construction essentials, including concrete blocks, pipes, and industrial bags.   

A defining characteristic of EMSTEEL's corporate strategy is its proactive pivot towards decarbonization and sustainable manufacturing. While traditional steelmaking via blast furnaces is one of the world's most carbon-intensive industrial processes, EMSTEEL's operations are based on natural gas-based Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) technology, which has an inherently lower carbon footprint. The company is amplifying this advantage by transforming its energy sourcing. By securing large-scale clean energy certificates from solar and nuclear sources, EMSTEEL reported a remarkable 35% year-over-year reduction in its Scope 1 and 2 emissions in 2022. This commitment is further solidified by tangible market-facing initiatives. The launch of its "TrueGreen™" line of low-carbon steel and its achievement of the ResponsibleSteel certification—the first in the MENA region to do so—are not merely environmental gestures. This represents a sophisticated strategic maneuver to turn a potential future liability, such as global carbon border taxes, into a distinct competitive advantage. By positioning itself as a leader in low-carbon steel, EMSTEEL is preparing to command a premium for its products in environmentally conscious export markets, thereby future-proofing its business model against evolving global regulations and consumer preferences.   

2.2. Key Steel Mills and Billet Producers
Beyond the dominant market leader, the UAE hosts a number of other significant steel producers, many of which are focused on recycling and specialized production.

Arabian Gulf Steel Industries (AGSI): Located in the Industrial City of Abu Dhabi (ICAD II), AGSI operates a modern steel melt shop with a production capacity between 400,000 and 600,000 tonnes per annum of steel billets. AGSI's most notable achievement is its status as a "Net Zero" emissions steel plant, certified as the first of its kind globally.

2.3. Chromite Resources and Potential
While the UAE is not a major global producer of chromite, it does possess and extract this important ferro-alloy mineral. Production data from the U.S. Geological Survey confirms the country's output of chromite ore, although volumes have shown significant fluctuation in recent years.   

The primary location for this activity is identified as the Fujairah Chrome Mine, a large open-pit mining operation located in the Emirate of Fujairah. Chromite ore is essential for the production of ferrochrome, a critical ingredient in the manufacturing of stainless steel and other corrosion-resistant superalloys. Beyond its metallurgical applications, chromite is also used for its refractory properties and in pigments.   

In addition to local extraction, the UAE serves as a trading hub for the mineral. Companies such as Arabian Minerals Trading and Galaxy Minerals are actively involved in the procurement and export of chromite ore, sourcing material from both the Fujairah mine and from the neighboring Sultanate of Oman. While the scale of the UAE's chromite mining is modest compared to its massive industrial minerals quarrying, its existence, coupled with an established trading infrastructure, indicates a niche capability in the ferro-alloy supply chain that could be expanded upon in the future.   

Chapter 3: Precious Metals Refining Hub
The United Arab Emirates, with Dubai at its epicenter, has firmly established itself as a premier global hub for the refining, trading, and logistics of precious metals. This status is built on a foundation of strategic location, state-of-the-art infrastructure, a favorable business environment, and a strong regulatory framework that fosters trust and transparency in the bullion market.

It has an annual production capacity of 3,600 metric tons of zinc ingots and 4,500 metric tons of zinc fines, using feedstocks such as zinc ash, zinc dross, and zinc dust.   

Other Suppliers and Traders: The market is also served by various traders and stockists of zinc and lead products. These include Al Taher Chemicals in Ajman, which supplies zinc ingots, and Reliance Alloy Steel Trading, which stocks and distributes zinc round bars and other forms.   

The structure of the base metals industry in the UAE reveals a deliberate and pragmatic industrial strategy. In the absence of significant domestic ore deposits for copper, zinc, or lead, the country has bypassed the capital-intensive and environmentally complex stage of primary smelting from raw concentrates. Instead, it has built a sophisticated and profitable industry focused on downstream, value-added manufacturing and secondary recycling. Companies like NUHAS and UCR are not mining companies but advanced manufacturers, transforming high-grade imported raw materials (copper cathodes) into essential industrial components. Simultaneously, firms like Sun Metal and USK Metals are champions of the circular economy, creating value by processing industrial waste and end-of-life scrap. This model leverages the UAE's strengths in logistics, low-cost energy, and modern infrastructure to serve regional demand for semi-finished metal products, representing a fundamentally different and more specialized business model compared to traditional, fully integrated mining and smelting hubs.

Chapter 5: Industrial Minerals: The Bedrock of the UAE's Extractive Industry
While the UAE is globally recognized for its downstream metals processing, its largest extractive sector by sheer volume is the quarrying of industrial rocks and minerals. This industry forms the literal bedrock of the nation's construction boom and is a major contributor to its non-oil exports. It is this sector that represents the true "mining" industry of the United Arab Emirates.

5.1. Sector Overview: Aggregates, Limestone, Dolomite, Gabbro
The geological landscape of the UAE provides the foundation for this thriving industry. The Hajar Mountains, which stretch across the northern and eastern Emirates, are the primary source of high-quality, hard rock resources. These formations contain vast deposits of limestone, dolomite, gabbro, and harzburgite, which are ideal for a wide range of industrial and construction applications.

Conclusion: Strategic Outlook and Key Insights
The comprehensive analysis of the United Arab Emirates' mining and mineral processing landscape reveals a sophisticated, dual-pronged industrial strategy that has successfully positioned the nation as both a regional powerhouse in resource extraction and a global hub for value-added manufacturing. The sector is not a monolithic entity but a complex ecosystem comprising two distinct but complementary domains: a high-volume industrial minerals quarrying industry and a capital-intensive, technologically advanced downstream metals processing industry. The findings confirm that the UAE's strength lies not in a diverse portfolio of primary metal mining, but in its strategic ability to leverage its geographical location, low-cost energy, world-class infrastructure, and state-led investment to build globally competitive industrial value chains.

The dominance of state-owned or state-affiliated enterprises in the most capital-intensive sectors—namely EGA in aluminium and EMSTEEL in steel—is a defining feature of the landscape. These national champions act as industrial anchors, driving technological innovation, securing complex international supply chains, and executing long-term strategies aligned with national economic diversification goals. Their success is intrinsically linked to the development of integrated industrial zones like KIZAD and JAFZA, which provide the critical logistical and infrastructural support necessary for these energy-intensive operations to thrive. The symbiotic relationship between these mega-producers and the nation's advanced ports and transport networks is a testament to a highly coordinated industrial policy.

Looking forward, several key trends are poised to shape the future of the sector. The Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure's initiative to develop comprehensive 3D maps of the nation's mineral resources signals a clear intent to better understand and strategically exploit its geological endowments, potentially leading to the development of new quarries or the discovery of other viable mineral deposits. In the established metals sectors, the global push for decarbonization represents both a challenge and a significant opportunity. The proactive steps taken by companies like EMSTEEL and AGSI to pioneer low-carbon and net-zero steel production are indicative of a broader strategic shift. This move towards sustainability is likely to become a crucial competitive advantage, allowing UAE producers to access premium markets and insulate themselves from future carbon-related trade barriers.   

The UAE's industrial minerals sector, particularly the export of construction aggregates from Ras Al Khaimah and Fujairah, is expected to remain robust, fueled by ongoing large-scale infrastructure and "giga-projects" across the GCC and broader Indian Ocean region. The nation's ability to extract and export millions of tonnes of high-quality limestone, gabbro, and dolomite efficiently will continue to be a significant source of non-oil revenue.

In final assessment, the UAE has successfully engineered a formidable position in the global minerals and metals industry. It has masterfully overcome its lack of primary metal ore deposits by creating a world-class processing hub that adds significant value to imported raw materials. Simultaneously, it has capitalized on its abundant rock resources to become a cornerstone of the regional construction supply chain. The nation's trajectory demonstrates a clear evolution from a hydrocarbon-dependent economy to a diversified industrial powerhouse, with its mining and mineral processing sectors standing as a key pillar of this successful transformation.
