The Mining and Minerals Sector of Armenia: A Comprehensive National Assessment
Strategic Overview of Armenia's Mining and Minerals Sector
The mining and minerals sector represents a foundational pillar of the Armenian economy, exerting a disproportionate influence on its industrial output, fiscal stability, and international trade profile. This section provides a strategic overview of the sector's economic significance, its rich geological endowment, and the evolving regulatory and investment landscape that will shape its future trajectory.

Economic Significance and Mineral Endowment
Armenia's economic structure is critically dependent on its mineral wealth. The mining sector contributes approximately 7% to the nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and was responsible for 6.8% of total government revenues in 2022. Its role in foreign trade is even more pronounced, with metals and ore concentrates accounting for 28% to 30% of the country's total exports. The primary commodities driving this export value are copper, molybdenum, gold, and silver, underscoring the sector's focus on metallic minerals.   

The industry's structure is highly concentrated, with a single entity, the Zangezur Copper and Molybdenum Combine (ZCMC), serving as its anchor. ZCMC is consistently the largest taxpayer in Armenia and is responsible for an estimated 60% of the entire mining sector's annual turnover. This concentration of economic power in one enterprise creates a "too big to fail" dynamic, making the national economy exceptionally sensitive to the operational and financial performance of a single asset. Any significant disruption at ZCMC, whether from technical issues, labor disputes, geopolitical events, or a downturn in global commodity prices, would transmit immediate and severe shocks to Armenia's state budget and trade balance. This reliance represents a significant systemic risk for the national economy.   

Geologically, Armenia is situated on the Tethyan Metallogenic Belt, one of the world's most significant metal-producing geological formations, which endows the country with substantial mineral resources. This has positioned Armenia as a top-ten global producer of molybdenum, a critical element in steel alloys. The state's official inventory of mineral resources registers more than 670 solid mineral mines. Among these are 30 metallic mines with confirmed resources, including seven copper-molybdenum deposits, four copper deposits, and 14 gold or gold-polymetallic deposits. In addition to these primary metals, Armenian ores contain valuable scarce and scattered elements such as rhenium, selenium, tellurium, and bismuth.   

The non-metallic sector, while extensive in terms of permits (over 400), is of a smaller economic scale. It primarily comprises quarries producing construction materials like travertine, tuff, and basalt to meet local demand, with limited export activity.   

Regulatory and Investment Landscape
The primary regulatory authority governing the sector is the Ministry of Territorial Administration and Infrastructure (MTAI), which is responsible for developing subsoil use policy, managing mineral resources, and issuing licenses. In recent years, the Armenian government has initiated a significant strategic overhaul of the sector's governance framework, aimed at enhancing transparency, attracting foreign investment, and modernizing its operational standards.   

A central component of this reform is a plan to establish a national geological service. This body would be tasked with conducting systematic geological exploration to identify new mineral deposits, which could then be offered to international investors, thereby expanding the country's resource base as existing mines approach depletion. A crucial element of this modernization is the planned transition from Soviet-era standards for assessing mineral reserves to the internationally recognized Australian Joint Ore Reserves Committee (JORC) Code. This shift is designed to make Armenian assets more legible and bankable for Western financial institutions and mining corporations.   

The cornerstone of the government's transparency agenda is its implementation of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), which Armenia joined as a candidate country in 2017. EITI compliance requires comprehensive disclosure of mining licenses, contracts, payments made to the government, and the ultimate beneficial owners of the companies holding these rights. This information is made publicly accessible through a dedicated online data portal, a move that has been recognized internationally as a model for economy-wide transparency.   

These reforms collectively signal a deliberate strategic pivot. The robust adoption of EITI and the move towards the JORC standard are not merely administrative updates but a calculated policy to shift the sector away from its opaque, post-Soviet legacy. By aligning with global best practices in governance and reporting, Armenia aims to de-risk its mining sector for a new class of international investors, particularly from the European Union and the United States, who prioritize high environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards and are averse to corruption. This strategic reorientation seeks to make the Armenian mining sector more predictable and attractive to Western capital, potentially creating a counterbalance to traditional Russian influence in the region while also introducing potential friction between new investment standards and the established practices of legacy operators.

Armenia's Major Metallic Mining Operations: In-Depth Profiles
This section provides granular profiles of the most significant metallic mining operations in Armenia. These assets collectively form the core of the industry and are central to the nation's economic performance, geopolitical positioning, and environmental challenges.

Zangezur Copper and Molybdenum Combine (ZCMC) - Kajaran Mine
The Kajaran Mine, operated by the Zangezur Copper and Molybdenum Combine (ZCMC), is the undisputed giant of the Armenian mining industry. Located in the town of Kajaran in the southern Syunik province, this massive open-pit operation is a porphyry copper-molybdenum deposit that serves as the economic bedrock of both the region and the nation. The integrated facility encompasses the open-pit mine, large-scale crushing facilities, and an enrichment plant that produces copper and molybdenum concentrates. As of 2024, the plant's annual ore processing rate is approximately 22.3 million tons, making it one of the largest operations of its kind in the region. The vast quantities of waste material, or tailings, generated by the plant are transported via a 32-kilometer pipeline system to a large tailings dam located at Artsvanik.   

The ownership structure of ZCMC is complex and has undergone significant recent transformation, reflecting the strategic importance of the asset. For many years, the German industrial group Cronimet Mining held a majority stake. However, in 2021, a controlling interest was acquired by "Industrial Company," a subsidiary of GeoProMining, a major regional mining player with Russian links. In a highly notable transaction following this acquisition, the new controlling entity gifted a 25% stake in ZCMC to the Government of Armenia. This move has fundamentally altered the relationship between the state and its most important industrial asset.   

This transfer of ownership signals a shift toward a quasi-state-controlled model, creating a powerful symbiosis that intertwines the nation's fiscal health directly with the mine's performance. With the government now a direct equity holder in its largest taxpayer, it is no longer just a regulator but also a direct beneficiary incentivized to maximize profitability and ensure operational continuity. This arrangement introduces a significant potential conflict of interest. In any future dispute pitting ZCMC's commercial or operational objectives—such as plans for expansion or matters of environmental compliance—against other state interests like environmental protection or community rights, the government's financial self-interest as a part-owner will be a powerful, perhaps decisive, factor. This dynamic could weaken its capacity to act as an impartial regulator and may lead to the subordination of environmental and social considerations to revenue generation imperatives.

GeoProMining Operations: Sotk Mine and Agarak Combine
GeoProMining is a dominant force in Armenia's precious and base metals sector, operating two of the country's most strategically significant assets: the Sotk gold mine and the Agarak copper-molybdenum combine.

Sotk (Zod) Gold Mine: The Sotk mine, located in the Gegharkunik province, is Armenia's largest gold deposit. Operated by GeoProMining Gold LLC since its acquisition in 2007, the mine's ore is transported by rail to the company's Ararat Gold Extraction Plant for processing into gold-silver doré bars. The mine's viability is profoundly complicated by its location, as the deposit straddles the international border with Azerbaijan. Following the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, control over the mine was physically divided between the two countries. This has had severe operational consequences; persistent cross-border gunfire from Azerbaijani military positions forced the company to suspend all open-pit mining activities in April 2023, restricting operations to much smaller and less productive underground sections.   

The situation at Sotk starkly illustrates that for key Armenian assets located in border regions, geopolitical conflict is not a latent background risk but a primary, daily operational variable. The mine's production capacity, financial viability, and long-term future are no longer dictated primarily by geological characteristics or global gold prices, but by military positioning, ceasefire stability, and the unresolved interstate conflict. This elevates the risk profile for any mineral deposit near the border to a level that may be unacceptable for traditional international mining investors, who typically cannot price or mitigate direct military threats to their operations.

Agarak Copper-Molybdenum Combine: Located in the Syunik province near the border with Iran, the Agarak Copper-Molybdenum Combine (ACMC) is another key asset in the GeoProMining portfolio. The facility consists of an open-pit mine and a processing plant that produces copper and molybdenum concentrates using flotation technology. The operation has been active for decades and is a major employer in the region. However, it has also been associated with significant environmental and social controversies. Local communities and environmental groups have raised persistent concerns regarding alleged pollution of the transboundary Araks river, air pollution from dust, and property damage to nearby homes caused by blasting at the mine.   

Teghut Copper and Molybdenum Mine
The Teghut mine, situated in the northern Lori province, is Armenia's second-largest copper-molybdenum deposit, with estimated ore reserves of 450 million tons. Operated by Teghout CJSC, a subsidiary of the Vallex Group, the mine commenced production in 2014 after a development phase that was heavily financed by Russia's VTB Bank, an entity that is now under international sanctions.   

The mine's operational history has been exceptionally volatile. In February 2018, operations were abruptly suspended after external consultants confirmed critical stability risks associated with its massive tailings dam, raising fears of a potential catastrophic failure. Operations were resumed in 2019 after remedial work, but the facility was suspended again in 2022 before finally restarting in August 2023. This history of instability highlights profound technical and environmental challenges.   

The crisis at Teghut serves as a critical warning for the entire Armenian mining sector. It demonstrates that the stability of tailings storage facilities is a systemic risk, particularly in a country characterized by mountainous topography and significant seismic activity. The fact that a major, modern mine was forced to halt production for an extended period due to this issue reveals that the costs of managing these vast waste repositories are substantial, under-appreciated liabilities. The government itself notes the existence of 15 large tailings facilities across the country, which collectively occupy 700 hectares and contain not only unutilized metals but also significant environmental hazards. The Teghut case suggests that the true cost of ensuring the long-term geotechnical stability and environmental safety of all of Armenia's tailings dams represents a massive, latent financial liability that could impact the profitability and operational viability of multiple mines.   

Kapan Mining and Processing Enterprise
The Kapan Mine is an underground gold-polymetallic operation located in the city of Kapan, Syunik province. The facility comprises the Shahumyan deposit and the Kapan processing plant. The plant utilizes flotation to produce two distinct concentrates: one rich in copper, gold, and silver, and a second zinc concentrate that also contains payable gold and silver credits.   

The mine has been the subject of significant merger and acquisition activity, reflecting a shifting investor landscape. Previously owned by the Russian mining major Polymetal, it was sold to the UK-listed Chaarat Gold Holdings in a deal valued at US$55 million. Polymetal's rationale for the sale included the mine's relatively high operating costs compared to its other assets. More recently, in September 2023, Chaarat Gold sold the mine to a local entity named Gold Mining Company LLC, which renamed the operator to Kapan Mining and Processing Company CJSC.   

This pattern of ownership churn, particularly the divestment by two successive international public companies, may be interpreted as a significant market signal. It suggests that smaller, standalone assets in Armenia, while possessing valuable reserves, may present operational challenges for international firms that must adhere to the stringent cost controls and risk management standards demanded by public markets. The successive sales could indicate a broader trend of Western and international junior or mid-tier miners exiting the country, unable to achieve the necessary economies of scale or manage the perceived geopolitical and operational risks. This may lead to a consolidation of such assets under the ownership of local or major regional players who operate with different cost structures, strategic objectives, or risk tolerances.

Lydian Armenia - The Amulsar Gold Project
The Amulsar project is a large-scale, low-grade gold deposit located in the Vayots Dzor province, strategically positioned to become Armenia's second-largest gold mine upon completion. The project is owned by Lydian Armenia, a subsidiary of Lydian Canada Ventures, which is in turn owned by the US-based Orion Mine Finance and Canada's Osisko Gold Royalties, giving it a strong Western backing.   

Despite being fully permitted, the project's development was halted for several years due to some of the most intense and sustained public protests in the history of Armenian mining. Environmental activists and local communities raised serious concerns that the mine's operations, particularly its use of cyanide heap leaching, could contaminate the vital mineral water sources of the nearby resort town of Jermuk and pollute Lake Sevan, a site of national strategic importance. After numerous environmental reviews and a prolonged standoff, the Armenian government has thrown its full support behind the project, taking the extraordinary step of acquiring a 12.5% equity stake to ensure its completion. A major new investment of US$250 million is being mobilized to finalize construction, with the first gold pour anticipated by the end of 2025.   

The Amulsar project has thus become the ultimate litmus test for the government's new "responsible mining" strategy. Its success or failure will reverberate throughout the international investment community. If the project proceeds to successful operation, it will serve as proof that large-scale, Western-backed mining projects adhering to high environmental standards can be successfully implemented in Armenia, potentially unlocking a new wave of foreign investment. Conversely, if the project is once again derailed by protests, legal challenges, or technical setbacks, it will strongly reinforce the perception of Armenia as a jurisdiction with unmanageable social and political risks for greenfield developments. Amulsar is no longer just a mine; it is a high-stakes referendum on the viability of the government's entire vision for the future of its mining sector.

Other Significant Mining and Processing Facilities
Beyond the major operations that dominate the sector, Armenia hosts a range of other metallic mines and specialized processing facilities that are crucial for a complete understanding of the industry's structure and capabilities.

Smelters and Dedicated Processors
Armenia's capacity for downstream processing is a critical component of its mining value chain, though it has faced significant challenges.

Alaverdi Copper Smelter: This historic smelter in the Lori province, owned by Armenian Copper Programme (ACP) CJSC, a member of the Vallex Group, has been a cornerstone of the regional industry for decades. However, its operations were suspended around 2018-2019 due to severe environmental violations. The facility's annual emissions of sulfur dioxide reached approximately 38,000 tons, vastly exceeding the permissible limit of 5,600 tons, leading to substantial fines. The company stated that fulfilling a government mandate to reduce emissions by 90% was technologically impossible with the existing plant and would require the construction of a new, modern smelter. A project for a new smelter is now part of the government's strategic discussions, with interest reportedly expressed by Chinese and Iranian firms, but it remains in the planning stages without concrete implementation. The suspension of the Alaverdi smelter highlights the profound environmental legacy issues facing Armenia's older industrial sites and the immense capital investment required to modernize them.   

Plant of Pure Iron OJSC: Located in Yerevan, this facility is a key player in Armenia's molybdenum processing sector. It is the country's first producer of ferromolybdenum and remains the sole producer of molybdenum metal, processing concentrate from mining operations. The company is also actively developing methods to enhance its value recovery by extracting byproducts such as rhenium from smelter fumes and copper from waste streams. The Plant of Pure Iron is also a shareholder in the Zangezur Copper and Molybdenum Combine, illustrating the interconnected nature of the industry's major players.   

Ararat Gold Extraction Plant: This processing facility, located in the town of Ararat, is an integral part of GeoProMining's gold operations. It receives all ore mined at the Sotk gold mine via railway for processing. The plant has been a subject of environmental concern from local communities, particularly regarding the safety and potential for contamination from its cyanide tailings dump.   

Polymetallic and Base Metal Operations
This group includes several mid-tier mines that contribute to Armenia's output of copper, gold, and other polymetallic concentrates.

Akhtala Mining and Processing Enterprise CJSC: This company operates the Shamlugh copper mine in the Lori province. The enterprise and its associated infrastructure have a significant and well-documented negative environmental footprint. The operation is responsible for three tailings dams—"Nazik," "Pahesti Dzor," and "Nahatak"—which are located in close proximity to residential areas. Studies conducted by academic and non-governmental organizations have found elevated levels of heavy metals, including lead, arsenic, and cadmium, in the soil, agricultural products, and even the blood of children in the affected communities, far exceeding permissible concentrations.   

Base Metals CJSC: A member of the Vallex Group, Base Metals CJSC is primarily known for its operations in the Nagorno-Karabakh region (Artsakh), where it constructed the Drmbon processing plant and has been developing the Kashen copper-molybdenum deposit. While the company is registered as a mining enterprise with a head office in Yerevan, its specific mining activities within the internationally recognized borders of Armenia are not clearly detailed in available information.   

Sagamar CJSC: This company holds the license for the Armanis gold-polymetallic mine in the Lori province. The mine has experienced periods of suspended operations, and the company is currently engaged in new geological prospecting activities in the surrounding "Chknagh-Armanis" area to evaluate further mineral potential. Sagamar is managed by Global Metals (Arm) Limited, which also oversees Molibdeni Ashkhar, indicating a consolidated management structure for these assets.   

Molibdeni Ashkhar Co.Ltd.: This company developed the Dastakert copper-molybdenum mine in the Syunik province. The company's beneficial ownership structure is notable; public declarations reveal its ultimate owners to be Russian billionaires Dmitry Korzhev and Dmitry Troitsky. Their ownership is held through a chain of intermediary companies, including Global Metals (Arm) Limited and entities registered in offshore jurisdictions such as Cyprus and the Isle of Man, a structure that complicates transparency.   

Ler-Ex LLC: Ler-Ex is the developer of the Hanqasar copper and molybdenum mine in Syunik. The company was involved in an accident that resulted in a discharge of sewage from a tailing pipe into the Geghi River. However, a subsequent investigation by the State Environmental Inspection concluded that contaminant levels did not exceed maximum permissible concentrations, and thus no damages were claimed from the company. Some reports indicate that Ler-Ex LLC is owned by the Zangezur Copper and Molybdenum Combine.   

Gold-Focused Operations
Meghradzor Gold LLC: This company operates the Meghradzor gold mine, located in the Kotayk province. For a period, the company transported its ore for processing at GeoProMining's Ararat Gold Extraction Plant. An attempt by Meghradzor Gold to construct its own gold enrichment facility using sodium cyanide was met with strong community opposition, citing risks to local agriculture and a nearby resort zone. The company's ownership has been linked to former employees of GeoProMining, suggesting close ties between the entities.   

The Industrial Minerals and Dimension Stone Sector
While often overshadowed by the high-value metallic mining industry, Armenia's industrial minerals and dimension stone sector is a significant component of its natural resource economy, characterized by a diversity of materials and a large number of operators.

Overview of Non-Metallic Resources
Armenia possesses vast and varied deposits of non-metallic minerals, a legacy of its complex volcanic geology. The country is particularly renowned for its high-quality dimension stones, including travertine, tuff (in various colors), basalt, granite, and marble. In addition to stone, Armenia has significant resources of other industrial minerals such as perlite, bentonite clay, diatomite, and zeolite. Unlike the metallic sector, which is dominated by a few large combines, the non-metallic sector is more fragmented, with over 400 permits issued for what are mostly smaller-scale quarrying and processing operations that primarily serve the domestic construction market.   

Profiles of Key Producers
Several companies have established themselves as leaders in the dimension stone market, leveraging modern technology to process Armenian stone for both domestic use and export.

Sisian-Shik CJSC: A prominent stone-processing company, Sisian-Shik operates its own basalt quarry in the Shaki community of Syunik province. The quarry covers 16 hectares and contains an estimated 1.1 million cubic meters of basaltic reserves. A key aspect of its operation is the use of non-blasting extraction methods, employing powerful excavators to work with natural fissures in the rock. This technique minimizes micro-fractures in the stone, ensuring a higher-quality raw material for processing. The company's plant produces a wide array of finished products, including exterior facing tiles, curbs, polished slabs, stairs, and custom-shaped architectural elements.   

Manana Stone LLC: Manana Stone is a major producer in the travertine and traonyx market, a type of onyx-like travertine. The company owns and operates several quarries in the Ararat valley, a region famous for its travertine deposits. Its holdings include the Goravan 1, Goravan 2, and Vedi quarries, with a total licensed area of approximately 80 hectares and an annual production capacity of around 15,000 cubic meters of stone blocks.   

Armenian Travertine Mining Company (ATMC) CJSC: ATMC is another leading, vertically integrated producer of travertine products. The company operates a large travertine quarry with a stated reserve of over 1.1 million cubic meters and runs a modern processing plant with a territory of 30,000 square meters. The plant is equipped with Italian machinery from world-renowned suppliers like Gaspari Menotti, enabling it to produce high-quality tiles and decorative elements. ATMC has a strong export focus, with established markets in Russia, other CIS countries, and a growing presence in the EU and the Middle East.   

Other Notable Operators: The dimension stone sector is populated by numerous other companies specializing in specific stone types. These include AAB Concern, which operates the Aramus basalt quarry; UNO STONE LLC and Multi Group Stone CJSC, both of which operate travertine quarries in the Ararat region; and Zeolite Pro CJSC, which quarries a unique green zeolite tuff in Nor-Koghb. Together, these companies contribute to a vibrant sector that showcases Armenia's diverse and high-quality stone resources.   

Synthesis and Strategic Outlook
The Armenian mining and minerals sector stands at a critical juncture, defined by a complex interplay of immense economic importance, legacy environmental challenges, geopolitical volatility, and a concerted push towards modern governance. The future of the industry will be determined by the nation's ability to navigate these competing forces.

Key Sectoral Trends and Challenges
The analysis of Armenia's mining and processing facilities reveals several dominant trends and systemic challenges that will shape the sector's evolution:

The Rise of the State as an Equity Partner: The government's acquisition of equity stakes in two of the country's most strategic assets—a 25% share in the operational ZCMC and a 12.5% share in the developing Amulsar project—marks a fundamental shift in its role. This move blurs the traditional line between regulator and operator, creating a powerful incentive for the state to prioritize revenue generation and operational continuity. While this may provide stability for these key projects, it raises significant governance questions about the potential for regulatory forbearance and the marginalization of environmental and social concerns.

Geopolitics as a Direct Operational Constraint: The situation at the Sotk gold mine, where open-pit operations have been halted by cross-border military activity, is a stark demonstration that geopolitical conflict is a primary operational risk, not a remote contingency. This reality severely impacts the valuation and bankability of any mineral deposit located in contested border regions, effectively sterilizing resources and deterring investment from all but the most risk-tolerant players.

Unresolved Environmental and Technical Liabilities: The legacy of Soviet-era and post-Soviet mining practices has left Armenia with a significant environmental burden, most notably in the form of numerous large tailings dams. The crisis at the modern Teghut mine, which was suspended due to fears of a dam collapse, serves as a potent warning. The stability of these structures represents a systemic financial and safety risk across the entire sector, requiring immense capital investment for assessment, remediation, and long-term management.

A Bifurcated Path to Modernization: The government's strategic push for transparency through EITI and the adoption of Western standards like JORC is creating a new, more transparent path for investment, as exemplified by the Amulsar project. However, this path coexists with an older, more opaque system characterized by complex ownership structures involving offshore entities, as seen with companies like Molibdeni Ashkhar. This creates a potential clash of cultures and standards between new, ESG-focused international investors and entrenched, legacy operators.

Forward-Looking Analysis
The Armenian government's stated strategy is to secure the long-term future of the sector by moving up the value chain and expanding its resource base. The pursuit of a new domestic copper smelter is a clear indication of the desire to capture more value from its mineral resources rather than exporting only raw concentrates. Simultaneously, the plan to launch a national geological service to identify new reserves, including critical minerals, addresses the reality that some of the country's major mines may be depleted within the next 15 to 20 years.   

The primary opportunity for Armenia lies in leveraging its position on the underexplored Tethyan Metallogenic Belt to attract new investment for discovery and development. The modernized and more transparent regulatory framework is a key enabler for this strategy. However, formidable risks remain. The unresolved conflict with Azerbaijan continues to cast a long shadow over the security of assets in large parts of the country. The massive, unfunded environmental liabilities associated with tailings and pollution require a credible and capitalized long-term solution. Finally, as the Amulsar saga has shown, the potential for strong social and environmental opposition to new projects remains a significant hurdle that requires sophisticated and genuine stakeholder engagement.   

Ultimately, the long-term success of Armenia's mining sector will depend on the government's ability to strike a difficult balance: to harness the industry's vital economic contributions while rigorously enforcing environmental standards, mitigating geopolitical risks, and ensuring that the benefits of resource extraction are shared equitably with the nation's citizens.
