The Australian Mining and Mineral Processing Asset Directory: A Comprehensive National Survey
Executive Summary and National Asset Overview
Introduction to Australia's Resource Endowment
Australia holds a commanding position in the global resources sector, underpinned by a vast and geologically diverse endowment of minerals. The nation is a world-leading producer of numerous key commodities, including bauxite, iron ore, lithium, gold, lead, rare earth elements, uranium, and zinc. Its mining industry, comprising over 350 operating mines, is a cornerstone of the national economy and a critical supplier to global industrial and technological value chains. The country's mineral wealth is not confined to bulk commodities; it also possesses significant deposits of mineral sands (ilmenite, zircon, rutile), base metals, precious metals, and an expanding portfolio of critical minerals essential for the global energy transition. This report provides a comprehensive directory of Australia's mining and mineral processing infrastructure, synthesizing data from national, state, and corporate sources to create a definitive reference for industry stakeholders.   

Data Sourcing and Methodology
A complete and accurate understanding of Australia's mineral asset portfolio requires a multi-layered data synthesis approach. A critical feature of the nation's resource data infrastructure is its federated structure. While national bodies such as Geoscience Australia provide essential summary products and continental-scale maps, the most detailed, current, and legally significant data resides with the respective state and territory government agencies.

This report's methodology is built upon this federated structure. The foundational inventory is derived from national-level datasets, primarily the Australian Operating Mines Map and its accompanying data, published annually by Geoscience Australia. This provides a comprehensive baseline of mines that are operating, under development, or on care and maintenance.   

This national dataset is then systematically cross-referenced, validated, and enriched with more granular, often real-time information from state and territory-level portals. These jurisdictional databases are intrinsically linked to regulatory functions, such as tenement management, resource estimation reporting (in accordance with the JORC Code), and environmental approvals, lending them a higher degree of detail and currency. Key state-level sources include:   

Western Australia: The Department of Energy, Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety (DEMIRS) MINEDEX and GeoVIEW.WA portals.   

Queensland: The Department of Natural Resources and Mines' GeoResGlobe and the Geological Survey of Queensland (GSQ) Open Data Portal.   

South Australia: The Department for Energy and Mining's South Australian Resource Information Gateway (SARIG).   

New South Wales: The Geological Survey of NSW's MinView and the Sharing and Enabling Environmental Data (SEED) portal.   

Northern Territory: The Department of Industry, Tourism and Trade's "Resourcing the Territory" and STRIKE portals.   

Tasmania: Mineral Resources Tasmania's (MRT) TIGER system and digital data downloads.   

Victoria: The Victorian Government Data Directory and GeoVic, which draw from the VICMINE database.   

This hierarchical approach ensures the final directory is both nationally comprehensive and jurisdictionally precise, reflecting the true nature of resource governance in Australia. For high-stakes analysis, such as investment due diligence or strategic planning, navigating these state-level systems is indispensable.

National Asset Snapshot
As of late 2023, Australia's mining sector comprised approximately 379 operating mines. In addition to these active operations, there were 38 projects classified as "under development" and 95 mines on "care and maintenance," representing a significant pipeline of future production and latent capacity. These assets collectively produce 19 useful minerals in significant quantities, reinforcing Australia's status as a globally significant and diversified resource supplier. The following master directory represents a consolidated list of these assets, compiled and verified through the methodology described above.

Jurisdictional Analysis of Mining and Processing Infrastructure
The national asset portfolio is best understood through a jurisdictional lens, as each state and territory possesses a unique geological profile, regulatory environment, and concentration of commodity-specific infrastructure. This regional specialization is a defining characteristic of the Australian mining industry.

Western Australia: The Engine Room of Australian Mining
Western Australia (WA) is the nation's preeminent mining jurisdiction, accounting for a substantial portion of Australia's total resource production value. Its dominance is most pronounced in iron ore, with the Pilbara region serving as a globally critical supply hub. The state is also a world-leading producer of gold, lithium, nickel, and alumina. The key regulatory and data custodian is the Department of Energy, Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety (DEMIRS).   

Key Assets:

Iron Ore: The Pilbara region hosts the vast, integrated mine-to-port iron ore networks of BHP (Western Australia Iron Ore - WAIO), Rio Tinto, and Fortescue. These operations include dozens of individual mines feeding into centralized processing hubs and dedicated heavy-haul rail lines connected to the export ports of Port Hedland and Dampier.   

Lithium: WA is the global leader in hard-rock lithium (spodumene) mining. Key assets include the Greenbushes mine, the world's largest, co-owned by IGO Limited and international partners, and the Pilgangoora operation, owned by Pilbara Minerals.

Data Portals:
The Victorian Government provides access to its resource data through the Data.Vic portal and the GeoVic web mapping application. These tools provide access to the VICMINE database, which contains information on mines, mineral occurrences, and historical mining activity.   

The jurisdictional analysis reveals a strong geographical-geological correlation across Australia's mining industry. Specific regions are overwhelmingly dominant for certain commodities, creating highly specialized infrastructure corridors and supply chains. The Pilbara region in Western Australia, for instance, hosts the key iron ore assets of BHP, Rio Tinto, and Fortescue, forming an integrated system of mines, rail, and ports dedicated to that single commodity. Similarly, Queensland's Bowen Basin is the location for a majority of the country's major metallurgical coal mines , while South Australia's major copper-gold mines are all situated within the Gawler Craton geological province. This intense regional concentration creates both efficiencies and vulnerabilities. Efficiencies are realized through the development of shared, large-scale infrastructure. However, vulnerabilities arise from localized risks, such as extreme weather events, regional labor constraints, or specific state-based regulatory changes, which can have an outsized impact on the global supply of that commodity.   

Directory of Major Downstream Processing Facilities
Beyond the extraction of raw ore, Australia possesses a significant and strategically important network of downstream processing facilities. These smelters and refineries add substantial value to the nation's mineral resources by transforming ores and concentrates into refined metals and intermediate products. This capacity is concentrated in a smaller number of large-scale, capital-intensive assets.

Alumina Refineries
Australia is one of the world's largest producers and exporters of smelter-grade alumina, the intermediate product between bauxite ore and aluminium metal. This capacity is concentrated in Western Australia and Queensland, located in proximity to major bauxite mines. There are five major alumina refineries currently operating in Australia.   

Queensland Alumina Limited (QAL) (Gladstone, QLD): A joint venture majority-owned by Rio Tinto, with Rusal holding a minority stake. It is one of the largest refineries in Australia by production capacity.   

Yarwun Alumina Refinery (Gladstone, QLD): Wholly owned by Rio Tinto, this modern refinery is located near QAL and processes bauxite from the Weipa mines.   

Worsley Alumina (Collie, WA): Majority-owned by South32, this is one of the largest and lowest-cost alumina refineries globally. It is fed by bauxite from the nearby Boddington bauxite mine.   

Pinjarra Alumina Refinery (Pinjarra, WA): Operated by Alcoa, this is one of the world's largest alumina refineries. It sources bauxite from the nearby Huntly mine.   

Wagerup Alumina Refinery (Wagerup, WA): Also operated by Alcoa, this refinery is supplied by the Willowdale bauxite mine.   

Kwinana Alumina Refinery (Kwinana, WA): Alcoa's oldest Australian refinery, which is scheduled for curtailment in 2024. It was supplied by the Huntly mine.   

Base Metal Smelting and Refining
Australia's capacity to smelt and refine base metals is critical for its copper, nickel, lead, and zinc value chains. These facilities are often integrated with major mining operations.

Copper:

Olympic Dam (Roxby Downs, SA): BHP operates a fully integrated mine, hydrometallurgical plant, copper smelter, and copper refinery at this single site, producing high-purity copper cathodes.   

Mount Isa Copper Smelter (Mount Isa, QLD): Operated by Glencore, this facility processes copper concentrate from its Mount Isa mines and other regional sources to produce copper anode.   

Townsville Copper Refinery (Townsville, QLD): Also operated by Glencore, this electrolytic refinery takes copper anode from the Mount Isa smelter and refines it into high-purity copper cathode for export.   

Nickel:

Kalgoorlie Nickel Smelter (Kalgoorlie, WA): Part of BHP's Nickel West division, this smelter processes nickel concentrate from the Leinster and Mt Keith mines into nickel matte.

Export to Sheets
The structure of Australia's downstream processing sector reveals a high degree of vertical integration, which stands as a key strategic feature of the landscape. This is most evident where major mining companies own and operate the processing facilities that handle their upstream production. For example, BHP's control of the entire Olympic Dam value chain—from underground mine to refined copper cathode—provides significant operational control and cost efficiencies. Similarly, Glencore's integrated network, where concentrates from Mount Isa are smelted in-house and then refined at its Townsville facility, secures the pathway from mine to market. In the alumina sector, Alcoa's "integrated bauxite mining, alumina refining... system" in Western Australia directly links its mines to its three local refineries, a model replicated by South32 at its Worsley operation. This integration provides major producers with a formidable competitive advantage through supply chain security and margin capture. Conversely, it creates high barriers to entry for new or junior miners who may lack access to this capital-intensive processing infrastructure, making them reliant on toll treatment or concentrate export markets.   

Asset Portfolios of Major Australian Mining Operators
Reorganizing the national asset portfolio from a corporate perspective illuminates the strategic positioning and operational footprint of the industry's most significant players. The landscape is characterized by a group of large, diversified miners with multi-commodity, multi-state portfolios, alongside major producers who are highly focused on a single commodity.

Zinc & Lead (QLD & NT): Glencore operates the Mount Isa zinc-lead mines (including George Fisher and Lady Loretta) in Queensland and the McArthur River Mine in the Northern Territory.   

Nickel & Cobalt (WA): The Murrin Murrin operation in Western Australia is a world-class integrated mine and refinery producing refined nickel and cobalt.   

South32
Demerged from BHP in 2015, South32 is a globally diversified mining and metals company with a significant Australian asset base.   

Alumina (WA): The company holds an 86% interest in Worsley Alumina, an integrated bauxite mine and one of the world's largest alumina refineries.   

Manganese (NT): South32 holds a 60% stake in the Groote Eylandt Mining Company (GEMCO), a world-leading producer of high-grade manganese ore.   

Silver, Lead & Zinc (QLD): The Cannington underground mine in Queensland is one of the world's largest producers of silver and lead.   

Newmont Corporation
Following its acquisition of Newcrest Mining, Newmont is a leading global gold company with a portfolio of premier, long-life assets in Australia.   

Cadia (NSW): One of Australia's largest and most profitable gold and copper mines.   

Boddington (WA): A world-class open-pit gold and copper mine, and one of the first to implement a fully autonomous haulage fleet.   

Tanami (NT): A long-life, high-grade underground gold mine located in the remote Tanami Desert.   

Other Major Producers
Yancoal Australia: A major pure-play coal producer, majority-owned by Yankuang Energy Group, with a portfolio of mines across NSW, Queensland, and Western Australia, including Moolarben, Hunter Valley Operations (JV), and Ashton.   

Evolution Mining: A leading Australian gold miner with a portfolio that includes the Cowal (NSW), Mungari (WA), and Mt Rawdon (QLD) gold mines, as well as an 80% interest in the Northparkes (NSW) copper-gold mine and an economic interest in the Ernest Henry (QLD) copper-gold mine.   

Northern Star Resources: A major global gold producer with three large-scale production centres: Kalgoorlie (including the KCGM Super Pit) and Yandal in Western Australia, and Pogo in Alaska, USA.   

Pilbara Minerals: A leading pure-play lithium company that owns and operates the Pilgangoora Lithium-Tantalum Project in Western Australia, one of the world's largest independent hard-rock lithium operations.   

The corporate structure of the Australian mining sector reveals a two-tiered system with distinct characteristics. The first tier consists of diversified "supermajors" like BHP, Rio Tinto, and Glencore, which control extensive portfolios of Tier 1 assets across multiple commodities and jurisdictions. The second tier is composed of large, highly successful producers that are predominantly focused on a single commodity, establishing them as leaders within their specific sectors, such as Fortescue in iron ore, Newmont and Northern Star in gold, and Yancoal in coal. This structure presents different strategic considerations for investors. Exposure to the supermajors offers diversification against single-commodity price volatility but may yield more moderate growth. In contrast, investment in the focused producers provides direct, leveraged exposure to a specific commodity's price cycle, offering the potential for higher growth but also carrying greater concentrated risk.   

Concluding Analysis and Strategic Outlook
The Geographic and Commodity Nexus
This comprehensive survey of Australia's mining and processing assets underscores the profound concentration of the industry into specialized regional hubs. These hubs—the Pilbara for iron ore, the Bowen Basin for metallurgical coal, the Kalgoorlie region for gold and nickel, the Gawler Craton for copper-gold-uranium, and the Mount Isa province for zinc-lead-silver—are not merely collections of individual mines. They are complex, integrated ecosystems of extraction, processing, and logistics infrastructure that are of critical importance to global supply chains. This regional specialization is a direct function of Australia's underlying geology, and it has shaped the development of dedicated rail lines, ports, power grids, and service industries tailored to the needs of each commodity.

The Mine-to-Market Value Chain
A recurring theme throughout this analysis is the high degree of vertical integration within the Australian resources sector. The nation's largest producers have strategically secured control over the entire value chain, from the mine pit to the export vessel. BHP's Nickel West, Alcoa's bauxite-alumina system, and Glencore's copper and lead circuits are prime examples of this mine-to-market control. This structure provides a formidable competitive advantage, enabling cost control, operational flexibility, and supply chain security. It also represents a significant barrier to entry for smaller players and reinforces the dominant market position of the established majors.

Future Outlook: Critical Minerals and the Energy Transition
While Australia's reputation is built on traditional commodities, its future lies increasingly in its capacity to supply the critical minerals required for the global energy transition and advanced manufacturing. The Australian government has identified 31 such commodities, including lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese, and rare earth elements, where the nation has significant geological endowment.   

Many of the assets listed in this directory are already pivotal to these new value chains. The lithium mines of Western Australia, the nickel and cobalt production from Nickel West and Murrin Murrin, and the manganese from Groote Eylandt are direct inputs for battery manufacturing and electric vehicles. The ongoing exploration and development of new projects in these and other critical minerals, such as rare earths, will see Australia's asset portfolio evolve. This strategic pivot ensures that the nation's mining and processing infrastructure will remain fundamental to the global economy, transitioning from a supplier for the industrial age to a foundational provider for a decarbonized and technologically advanced future.
