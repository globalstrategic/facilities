The Mines and Mineral Processing Facilities of Austria: A Comprehensive National Assessment
Part I: The Austrian Mineral Sector - A Strategic Overview
1.1 Introduction: A Modern, Specialized Industry with Deep Historical Roots
The Republic of Austria, while geographically modest, possesses a mineral resources sector characterized by a remarkable duality: a deep and storied mining history that stretches back millennia, coexisting with a modern, highly specialized industry focused on a select portfolio of commodities in which it holds a globally significant position. The nation's industrial landscape is not defined by a broad-based extraction industry typical of larger resource-rich countries. Instead, it is a testament to a successful, long-term strategy of targeted specialization, technological leadership, and profound vertical integration. This approach has allowed Austria to secure critical domestic supply chains, foster industrial resilience, and establish itself as a key supplier of high-value materials to the European and global economies.

The historical roots of Austrian mining are among the deepest in Europe. Salt has been mined in the Salzkammergut region for over 7,000 years, with the Hallstatt mine being the oldest of its kind in the world. The Styrian Erzberg, or "Ore Mountain," has been a source of iron for more than 1,300 years, forming the bedrock of the region's identity and industrial development. Similarly, the Bleiberg district in Carinthia was a center of lead and zinc mining for over seven centuries, with its first documented mention in 1333. This extensive history, which also includes significant past production of copper, silver, and antimony, has endowed the nation with a rich legacy of mining culture and a vast geological knowledge base.   

However, the modern reality of the Austrian mineral sector is one of consolidation and focus. Over the latter half of the 20th century, structural changes in global commodity markets and evolving economic priorities led to the closure of most of the country's metallic ore mines. What has emerged from this transformation is a sophisticated industry that leverages Austria's unique geological endowments in a few key areas. The sector is now dominated by the production of industrial minerals, where Austria is a world leader, and the strategic extraction of iron and tungsten, which are fundamental to the nation's powerful steel and high-technology manufacturing sectors. This strategic focus is underpinned by a business model where major extraction operations are often directly integrated with domestic processing and manufacturing, creating a closed-loop system that maximizes value capture and minimizes supply chain vulnerability. This structure demonstrates a deliberate industrial policy that prioritizes quality, technological innovation, and supply security over sheer volume, positioning Austria as a niche but indispensable player in the global raw materials landscape.   

1.2 The Primacy of Industrial Minerals: Austria's Global Niche
While the historical narrative of Austrian mining is often associated with metals, the contemporary economic reality is firmly anchored in the extraction and processing of industrial minerals. It is in this domain that Austria transcends its status as a smaller European nation to become a significant global producer. The country's mineral extraction sector is overwhelmingly dominated by the production of high-quality industrial minerals such as magnesite, talc, and salt, alongside vast quantities of construction minerals and aggregates. This focus has allowed Austrian companies to carve out powerful market positions, often becoming global leaders in specialized, high-value applications.   

According to global production statistics, Austria consistently ranks among the top producers for several key industrial minerals. It is the world's sixth-largest producer of magnesite, a critical component for the refractory industry used in high-temperature processes like steelmaking. This production is not merely a matter of volume but also of quality, with Austrian deposits yielding materials suitable for the most demanding applications. Similarly, the nation ranks as the seventh or eighth-largest global producer of tungsten, an industrial metal with properties so unique it is classified as a critical raw material by the European Union. In the talc market, Austria is the 14th-largest producer globally, with its deposits in Styria representing the largest in Central Europe.   

This leadership is not accidental but is the result of leveraging world-class geological deposits through highly advanced extraction and processing technologies. Austrian companies have developed specialized procedures to produce materials tailored to precise customer specifications. For example, an Austrian talc producer has pioneered a process to create very finely ground talc powder with outstanding properties for the plastics industry, which is then supplied to global customers in a compacted form, showcasing innovation in both processing and logistics. This ability to innovate and add value to its natural endowments is a hallmark of the Austrian industrial minerals sector, transforming raw materials into sophisticated, sought-after products that are integral to a wide range of global manufacturing value chains.   

1.3 Strategic Metals Production: Securing the Industrial Base
Beyond its dominance in industrial minerals, Austria maintains a highly strategic and economically vital presence in the production of two key metals: iron and tungsten. These operations are not merely mines in the conventional sense; they are foundational pillars of the national industrial base, providing secure, domestic sources of raw materials for two of Austria's most important manufacturing sectors—steel and high-technology components. According to the Austrian Mineral Resources Act, all metallic ores are classified as "minerals free for mining," and iron and tungsten are the two that can be produced at an economically competitive level within the country.   

The cornerstone of Austria's ferrous metals industry is the Styrian Erzberg mine. Located in the town of Eisenerz, this massive open-pit operation exploits the world's largest deposit of siderite, an iron-carbonate mineral. For over 1,300 years, the Erzberg has been the heart of Austrian iron and steel production, and it continues to be the captive source of iron ore for the country's leading steelmaker, voestalpine AG. The mine's output is fundamental to the operations of voestalpine's integrated steelworks in Linz and Donawitz, making it an indispensable strategic asset for the nation's entire steel value chain, from raw material to high-quality finished products.   

Equally significant, though in a different industrial context, is the production of tungsten. The Felbertal scheelite deposit in the province of Salzburg is one of the largest tungsten deposits in the Western world. Discovered in 1967 and exploited since 1975, this underground mine is a critical source of a metal prized for its extreme hardness and the highest melting point of all elements. Tungsten has transitioned from its historical use in lightbulb filaments to become an essential high-tech component in the tool, automotive, aviation, energy, and electronics industries. Recognizing its economic importance and the high risk associated with its supply, the European Commission has designated tungsten as a "critical raw material" (CRM). The operation at Felbertal, therefore, provides Austria and Europe with a secure, non-Chinese source of this vital material, underpinning a sophisticated domestic industry that produces high-value tungsten powders and carbides.   

1.4 Key Corporate Actors and Market Structure: A Landscape of Integrated Giants
The Austrian mining and mineral processing landscape is notable for its concentration of ownership and a prevalent business model of deep vertical integration. A handful of powerful, technologically advanced corporations dominate the sector, often controlling the entire value chain from the mine or quarry to the production of highly refined, value-added products. This structure is a key factor in the industry's resilience and global competitiveness.

The most prominent actor in the ferrous sector is voestalpine AG, a global steel and technology group headquartered in Linz. Through its subsidiary, VA Erzberg GmbH, it operates the Erzberg iron ore mine as a captive supply source for its major steel plants in Linz and Donawitz. This integration extends to other raw materials, with voestalpine also operating its own limestone quarry at Steyrling to supply its steelmaking operations, ensuring control over the quality and availability of its key inputs.   

In the strategic tungsten sector, the key player is Wolfram Bergbau und Hütten AG (WBH). WBH operates the Mittersill (Felbertal) scheelite mine in Salzburg and a sophisticated refining and powder manufacturing facility in St. Martin im Sulmtal. Since 2009, WBH has been a subsidiary of the Swedish engineering group Sandvik AB, making it a critical part of a global high-tech tooling and materials conglomerate. This structure gives WBH a secure offtake for its mine production and direct access to global end-markets.   

The industrial minerals sector is similarly characterized by large, integrated players. RHI Magnesita, a global leader in refractory products, operates Austria's major magnesite mines in Styria, Carinthia, and Tyrol, directly feeding its own processing plants to produce materials for the high-temperature industries. Salt production is the exclusive domain of Salinen Austria AG, which controls all three active brine extraction sites and the central processing plant at Ebensee, making it the country's sole salt producer. In the talc sector, the French multinational Imerys operates the Rabenwald and Kleinfeistritz mines and associated processing plants, integrating these Austrian assets into its global industrial minerals portfolio.   

This pattern of vertical integration, where the miner is also the primary processor and often a major end-user, is a defining feature of the Austrian model. It fosters long-term planning, secures supply chains, facilitates investment in advanced technology, and allows for the development of highly specialized products tailored to specific market needs.

1.5 Regulatory and Data Framework: Governance of the Sector
The governance of Austria's mining and mineral resources sector is centralized and well-defined, with specific federal bodies responsible for regulation, safety, and data management. This clear framework provides a stable environment for investment and ensures that operations adhere to national and European standards.

Uniquely among many nations, the supreme competent authority for mining in Austria is the Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) (Bundesministerium für Finanzen). This responsibility is managed within Section VI of the ministry, which covers Telecommunications, Post, and Mining. The BMF's Mining Division is structured into several directorates responsible for legal affairs, mineral resources policy, technology, and safety, with regional mining authorities located in Vienna (Mining Authority East), Salzburg (Mining Authority West), and Leoben (Mining Authority South) to oversee operations on the ground. While the BMF is the primary authority, mining activities are also subject to a range of other federal laws, including those governing environmental impact assessment, water management, and land use planning.   

The scientific and data-management foundation for the sector is provided by GeoSphere Austria, the national institution formed from the merger of the Geological Survey of Austria (GBA) and the Central Institution for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG). GeoSphere Austria is tasked with the geological survey of the country, collecting and analyzing rock samples, and compiling comprehensive data on active and abandoned mining regions and raw material deposits.   

A critical tool developed and maintained by the geological authorities is the Interactive Raw Material Information System (IRIS-Online). IRIS-Online serves as the definitive national database for mineral resources. It is an evolution of the "Metallogenetic Map of Austria," first published in 1997, and provides interactive access to multiple layers of information, including geological maps, data on over 3,300 raw material occurrences, geochemical survey results from tens of thousands of samples, and aeromagnetic data. This powerful, publicly accessible system represents the primary source of authoritative geoscientific and mineral resource data for the country, supporting scientific research, commercial exploration, and regulatory oversight.   

Part II: Active Mining and Quarrying Operations
This section provides detailed profiles of Austria's significant active extraction sites, organized by commodity type. The analysis synthesizes data on location, ownership, geology, operational scale, and strategic importance, illustrating the concentrated and highly specialized nature of the country's primary resource base.

2.1 Metallic Ore Mines
Austria's active metallic ore mining sector is concentrated into two world-class operations: the Erzberg iron ore mine and the Mittersill tungsten mine. These are not speculative ventures but are deeply integrated, strategic assets that form the upstream foundation of major domestic industrial value chains.

2.1.1 Erzberg Mine (Styria)
Location: The Erzberg Mine is situated in the heart of Styria, near the historic mining town of Eisenerz. Its geographic coordinates are approximately 47.531°N, 14.904°E.   

Ownership & Operator: The mine is operated by VA Erzberg GmbH, a company wholly owned by the Erzberg Privatstiftung (a private foundation). Functionally, it operates as a captive mine, with its entire output dedicated to supplying the steelworks of voestalpine AG, Austria's largest steel producer. This direct link makes the mine's viability intrinsically tied to the health of voestalpine's steel production in Linz and Donawitz.   

Geology & Deposit: The Erzberg is a geological anomaly of global significance, representing the world's largest deposit of the iron mineral siderite (FeCO 
3
​
 ). The deposit is hosted within Paleozoic metamorphosed sedimentary rocks of the Greywacke Zone. The ore is a mixture of siderite with other carbonate minerals, primarily ankerite, resulting in an average iron content of approximately 33%, though it can range from 22% to 40%.   

Operations: Since the cessation of underground mining in 1986, Erzberg has been exclusively an open-pit operation. The mine is a visually striking landmark, characterized by its massive, multi-level terraces that ascend the mountain. The scale of the operation is substantial, with approximately 7 million tonnes of raw material extracted annually to produce between 2 and 3 million tonnes of high-quality iron ore. To achieve this, the mine employs advanced sensor-based sorting technology. A REDWAVE X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) system is used to analyze the crushed rock in real-time, separating valuable ore from waste rock and precisely managing the content of deleterious elements, such as mercury which occurs in the form of cinnabar inclusions.   

Commodities: The primary commodity is Iron Ore. The initial user list also noted Manganese as a secondary commodity, which is a common alloying element in steelmaking and often associated with iron deposits [User List]. The principal ore mineral is siderite, with ankerite also being a significant component of the ore body.   

2.1.2 Mittersill Scheelite Mine (Felbertal Mine) (Salzburg)
Location: Known interchangeably as the Mittersill Mine and the Felbertal Mine, this operation is located in the Felbertal valley, approximately 8 kilometers south of the town of Mittersill in the state of Salzburg. Its coordinates are approximately 47°13′33.53″N, 12°29′19.36″E.   

Ownership & Operator: The mine is owned and operated by Wolfram Bergbau und Hütten AG (WBH). WBH was acquired by the Swedish high-technology group Sandvik AB in 2009, making the mine a key upstream asset in Sandvik's vertically integrated tungsten business.   

Geology & Deposit: The Mittersill-Felbertal deposit is the largest and most significant scheelite (CaWO 
4
​
 ) deposit in Europe. The mineralization is hosted within a complex suite of polymetamorphic rocks assigned to the Habach Complex, located within the Hohe Tauern mountain range's "Tauern Window," a geological feature exposing older rocks beneath younger formations. The deposit is divided into an Eastern Ore Zone and a Western Ore Zone.   

Operations: Mining began as an open-pit operation in the Eastern Ore Zone in 1975, but since 1986, all production has come from underground mining in the Western Ore Zone. The mine is a state-of-the-art underground facility, producing approximately 550,000 tonnes of ore per year. This raw ore is processed to yield around 1,200 tonnes of tungsten trioxide (WO 
3
​
 ) annually. A key logistical feature is an environmentally friendly underground conveyor belt system that transports the mined ore three kilometers down the valley to the processing plant located at the Felbertauern Highway. To address the challenges of deeper mining and longer transport routes, WBH recently commissioned a new, highly advanced Sandvik processing plant deep within the mountain, an investment designed to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and secure the mine's future for an estimated 25 more years.   

Commodities: The sole primary commodity is Tungsten, extracted from the mineral scheelite.

The deep integration of these two metallic ore mines into larger industrial concerns highlights a key characteristic of the Austrian resource sector. The viability of the Erzberg mine is not solely dependent on global iron ore prices but on the strategic decisions and market success of voestalpine. A downturn in European steel demand or a strategic shift by voestalpine away from blast furnace production would have an immediate and direct impact on the mine's operational future. Similarly, the Mittersill mine's fate is inextricably linked to that of its parent company, WBH, and the global demand for the high-tech tungsten powders it produces for Sandvik's tooling business. This creates a highly efficient but interconnected system where the upstream mining operations are directly exposed to the market dynamics of their downstream industrial customers.

2.2 Industrial Mineral Mines & Quarries
The backbone of Austria's contemporary mining industry is the extraction of a diverse range of industrial minerals. Operations are led by major multinational and domestic companies that have established dominant positions in global markets for magnesite, salt, talc, and other specialized minerals.

2.2.1 Magnesite Operations (Styria, Carinthia, Tyrol)
Overview: Austria is a powerhouse in the global magnesite market, a mineral essential for producing refractory materials capable of withstanding the extreme temperatures of steelmaking, cement production, and other industrial processes. The industry is dominated by RHI Magnesita GmbH, a global leader in the refractory sector, which operates several key mines across the country.   

Key Sites (RHI Magnesita):

Breitenau Mine (Styria): Located at Magnesitstraße 30 in Breitenau, this is one of the world's largest and most significant underground magnesite mines, forming a cornerstone of RHI Magnesita's raw material supply.   

Radenthein Mine (Carinthia): This active site, located at Millstaetter Straße 10 in Radenthein, is another crucial mining operation for the company in southern Austria.   

Hochfilzen Mine (Tyrol): Situated in the Tyrol region at Regio Tech 2, Hochfilzen, this mine secures a geographically diverse source of magnesite for the company.   

Veitsch/Millstaetter Alpe Mine (Styria/Carinthia): These historic operations are part of the company's extensive portfolio of magnesite assets.   

Other Producers: While RHI Magnesita is the dominant force, Styromagnesit Steirische Magnesitindustrie GmbH also contributes to Austria's output, operating smaller mines at locations including Hoehentauern, Kaintaleck, and Wald.   

2.2.2 Salt Mines (Upper Austria, Styria)
Overview: The Austrian salt industry is a monopoly controlled by Salinen Austria AG, the nation's sole producer. The company's modern strategy involves extracting brine (salt-saturated water) from three historic mining areas in the Salzkammergut region. This brine is then transported via an extensive pipeline network to a central processing plant in Ebensee for evaporation and salt production.   

Key Sites:

Altaussee Mine (Styria): Located at Lichtersberg 25 in Altaussee, this is the largest active salt mine in Austria. Since 1965, production has been conducted using modern borehole solution mining, where fresh water is pumped into the underground salt deposit to create brine, which is then extracted.   

Hallstatt Mine (Upper Austria): Famed as the world's oldest salt mine with a 7,000-year history, Hallstatt is a UNESCO World Heritage site and a major tourist attraction. While tourism is its primary function today, it remains an active part of the brine extraction network for Salinen Austria AG.   

Bad Ischl Mine (Upper Austria): A historic salt mining area that played a key role in the development of Bad Ischl as a spa town. Today, traditional underground mining has ceased, and brine is extracted from a modern, above-ground probe field.   

2.2.3 Talc & Leucophyllite Mines (Styria)
Overview: Austria is home to the largest talc deposit in Central Europe, with operations managed by Imerys Talc Austria GmbH, a subsidiary of the French industrial minerals multinational Imerys.   

Key Sites:

Rabenwald Mine (Styria): This large open-pit mine is the centerpiece of Austrian talc production, yielding approximately 100,000 tons of talc per year. Located on the edge of a nature park, the operation places a strong emphasis on progressive land rehabilitation.   

Kleinfeistritz Mine (Styria): This is an underground mine that extracts a rare and valuable mineral known as leucophyllite. This coalescence of minerals is marketed under the trademark Plastorit® and is particularly prized by the paint industry for its unique properties.   

2.2.4 Graphite Mine (Styria)
Kaisersberg Mine: Located at Bergmannstrasse 39, St. Stefan ob Leoben, the Kaisersberg operation is the last active graphite mine in the entire Alpine region. Operated by the privately held Grafitbergbau Kaisersberg GmbH, the underground mine has been active since 1755. It produces microcrystalline (often referred to as amorphous) graphite, which is used in a wide range of industrial applications, from carbon brushes and batteries to fire retardants and lubricants. While Austria's total output is small on a global scale, the Kaisersberg mine represents one of the few European sources of this critical raw material.   

2.2.5 Kaolin Mines (Upper Austria)
Overview: Austria's only economically viable kaolin deposits are located in Upper Austria and are operated by KAMIG (Kärntner Montanindustrie GmbH).   

Key Sites:

Kriechbaum Mine (Allerheiligen im Mühlkreis): This open-pit mine is the primary source of Austrian kaolin, a white clay mineral essential for the ceramics, paper, and paint industries. The mine also produces quartz sand as a co-product.   

Mistlberg Mine: This smaller operation extracts kaolin specifically for use in the brick manufacturing industry.   

2.2.6 Limestone & Construction Aggregates
Steyrling Quarry (Brennet Quarry) (Upper Austria): This is arguably the most strategically important quarry in Austria. Operated by voestalpine Stahl GmbH, this active limestone quarry is located on the Brennet mountain, the southeasternmost elevation of the Kremsmauer range. With an annual production of approximately 1.3 million tonnes, the quarry provides a critical supply of high-quality limestone, which is an essential fluxing agent for the steelmaking process at voestalpine's integrated works in Linz and Donawitz. Its location and captive ownership ensure a secure and cost-effective supply chain for this vital industrial input. The geographic coordinates are 47.81082°N, 14.15284°E.   

Kremsmauer Mountain Quarry (Upper Austria): The initial data provided by the user listed this as a separate quarry owned by voestalpine [User List]. However, extensive research indicates that "Kremsmauer" is the name of the mountain massif where the Steyrling/Brennet quarry is located. Therefore, for the purpose of this report, the "Kremsmauer Mountain Quarry" is identified as the same operation as the Steyrling/Brennet quarry, clarifying a point of potential confusion.   

Part III: Mineral Processing, Smelting, and Refining Facilities
Austria's mineral processing sector is a critical component of its industrial economy, transforming both domestically sourced and imported raw materials into high-value intermediate and finished products. This downstream segment is characterized by technological sophistication, a strong focus on recycling and sustainability, and its role as a specialized "finishing hub" for the wider European market.

3.1 Ferrous Metals (Iron & Steel)
The Austrian iron and steel industry is dominated by voestalpine AG, which operates a network of highly advanced production and processing facilities. These plants are central to the European automotive, construction, and energy sectors.

voestalpine Stahl Linz: Located at voestalpine-Straße 3, 4020 Linz, this is the group's flagship facility and one of Europe's most modern integrated steelworks. It receives the bulk of the iron ore from the Erzberg mine and operates the full production chain, including blast furnaces (BF) and basic oxygen furnaces (BOF). The Linz site is at the forefront of the industry's green transition. Under the "greentec steel" initiative, voestalpine is investing €1.5 billion to construct a new electric arc furnace (EAF) at the site, scheduled for commissioning by 2027. This investment is a key step in the company's plan to shift away from coal-based steel production towards a more sustainable, electricity-based process using scrap and hot briquetted iron.   

voestalpine Stahl Donawitz: Situated in Leoben-Donawitz, Styria, this is the second major steel production hub for voestalpine, also supplied with ore from Erzberg. Like the Linz plant, the Donawitz site is a focus of major modernization and decarbonization efforts. It is home to the new, highly digitized CC4 continuous casting plant, which replaced an older unit and significantly enhances the quality and efficiency of steel production. The Donawitz facility is also slated to receive a new EAF as part of the "greentec steel" program, mirroring the transition underway in Linz.   

voestalpine Krems: This site in Lower Austria serves as the headquarters for voestalpine's Metal Forming Division and is a center for advanced downstream processing. Rather than producing raw steel, the Krems facility specializes in manufacturing high-value products such as special pipes, precision steel profiles, and complex systems for high-bay warehouses and road safety.   

3.2 Non-Ferrous & Strategic Metals
Austria's non-ferrous and strategic metals processing sector is highly specialized and has undergone a fundamental shift towards a circular economy model. The country's facilities are key nodes in the European supply chain for recycled and high-purity metals.

Wolfram Bergbau und Hütten AG Facility (St. Martin im Sulmtal): This is the heart of Austria's tungsten industry and the only integrated tungsten producer outside of Asia. Located at Bergla 33, 8543 St. Martin, the plant processes the scheelite concentrate from the company's own Mittersill mine, as well as imported concentrates and secondary raw materials (scrap). It uses advanced hydrometallurgical processes to produce a range of high-quality, tailor-made tungsten carbide and tungsten metal powders, which are essential for manufacturing cutting tools, wear parts, and other high-performance components.   

Montanwerke Brixlegg AG Refinery (Brixlegg, Tyrol): As Austria's sole copper producer, this refinery is a prime example of the industry's pivot to recycling. The facility has operated for over 550 years but transitioned to a 100% recycling model in 1977. It processes approximately 160,000 tonnes of copper-bearing secondary materials—such as scrap from electronics, vehicles, and industrial processes—to produce around 120,000 tonnes of high-purity (99.99% Cu) copper cathodes annually. The company actively markets its product as "green copper" with one of the lowest carbon footprints in the industry, a significant competitive advantage in an ESG-focused market. The refinery also recovers valuable by-products, including precious metals like gold and silver, nickel sulphate, and iron silicate.   

Ecobat Resources Austria (Arnoldstein, Carinthia): This facility represents the modern incarnation of a historic smelting site. Located in the industrial park that replaced the former Bleiberger Bergwerks Union (BBU) primary lead-zinc smelter, Ecobat operates a secondary lead smelter. It specializes in recycling lead-acid batteries and other lead-bearing waste to produce approximately 27,000 tonnes of refined lead and lead alloys per year, along with by-products like sodium sulphate and polypropylene. The transformation of the Arnoldstein site from a source of significant historical pollution to a modern recycling hub exemplifies the circular economy transition.   

3.3 Light Metals (Aluminum)
AMAG Austria Metall AG Plant (Ranshofen): This large, integrated aluminum facility in Upper Austria is a leading European supplier of high-quality cast and rolled aluminum products, particularly for the demanding aerospace, automotive, and packaging industries. The plant's core competence is recycling; it utilizes a raw material mix containing 75-80% scrap, a figure the company cites as an international industry benchmark. This focus on recycling is supplemented by primary aluminum sourced from AMAG's 20% equity stake in the Aluminerie Alouette smelter in Canada, which is powered entirely by hydroelectricity, ensuring access to low-carbon primary metal. The Ranshofen facility integrates a casthouse for producing foundry alloys and a state-of-the-art hot and cold rolling mill for producing plates, sheets, and strips.   

3.4 Industrial Mineral Processing Plants
Complementing the extraction sites, Austria has a network of specialized plants for processing industrial minerals into finished products for global markets.

Salinen Austria AG Salt Works (Ebensee): Located at Steinkogelstraße 30, Ebensee, this is the central processing facility for all Austrian salt. It receives brine via pipeline from the extraction sites at Altaussee, Hallstatt, and Bad Ischl. Through a large-scale evaporation process, the plant produces 1.2 million tonnes of salt annually for a wide range of uses, from table salt to industrial and pharmaceutical applications.   

Imerys Processing Facilities:

Oberfeistritz & Weisskirchen (Styria): These two plants are dedicated to processing the raw materials from Imerys's talc and leucophyllite mines. They employ advanced milling and processing technologies to convert the crude ores into a diverse portfolio of fine and ultra-fine powders, engineered to meet the specific requirements of the paint, plastics, paper, and animal feed industries.   

Villach (Carinthia): This major Imerys facility, located at Seebach 2, Villach, is focused on producing fused minerals for the abrasives and refractories markets. It manufactures approximately 90,000 tons of minerals annually, primarily brown and white fused alumina (corundum) and synthetic ceramic corundum. Crucially, the site is also home to the Imerys Technology Center (ITC), a significant research and development hub with 35 engineers and technicians working on new materials and applications for a range of industries.   

voestalpine Lime Plant (Steyrling): Co-located with its captive limestone quarry, this plant is an essential part of voestalpine's steelmaking infrastructure. It operates a series of modern Maerz Parallel Flow Regenerative (PFR) kilns to calcine the extracted limestone, producing high-quality burned lime. This lime is then transported to the Linz and Donawitz steelworks, where it is used as a flux to remove impurities during the steel production process.   

The country's processing and refining sector clearly functions as a strategic value-adding hub for Europe. Facilities like WBH in St. Martin, Montanwerke Brixlegg, and AMAG are not merely processing domestic resources; they are leveraging Austria's technological expertise, stable infrastructure, and central location to transform both domestic and imported raw materials and scrap into high-purity, specialized, and sustainable products. This positions Austria as an indispensable node in the European supply chain for materials that are critical for the continent's green and digital transitions.

Part IV: Inactive, Historic, and Exploration-Stage Assets
Beyond its active operations, Austria's mineral landscape is defined by a rich legacy of past mining activities and a new wave of exploration focused on critical raw materials for the modern economy. The country's extensive mining history provides a unique "brownfield" advantage, where historic districts with well-documented geology and existing infrastructure are being re-evaluated for minerals that were once considered by-products but are now of immense strategic importance.

4.1 Case Study: The Bleiberg Mining Area (Carinthia) - From Historic Mine to Critical Mineral Prospect
The Bleiberg district in Carinthia serves as a compelling case study for the re-imagining of historic mining areas in the 21st century. Once a cornerstone of the European lead and zinc industry, it is now at the forefront of exploration for germanium, a critical semiconductor metal.

Historical Context: The Bleiberg-Kreuth mining area has a documented history of lead and zinc production stretching back to 1333. For centuries, it was a sprawling district of numerous small operations until 1867, when they were consolidated into the powerful Bleiberger Bergwerks Union (BBU). The BBU was a major industrial conglomerate in the Austro-Hungarian Empire and its successor states, with interests that also included the Mežica mine in modern-day Slovenia and the Bernstein antimony mine. The Bleiberg mines were finally closed in 1993, succumbing to a combination of low global metal prices and the bankruptcy of the state-owned conglomerate that controlled the BBU.   

Historic Production and Geology: Over its operational life, the district produced an estimated 1.1 million tonnes of lead and 1.1 million tonnes of zinc. The deposit is a classic Mississippi Valley Type (MVT) mineralization, with the primary ore minerals being galena (lead sulfide) and sphalerite (zinc sulfide) hosted in Triassic limestones. Significantly, the ores also contained valuable by-products, including 993 tonnes of cadmium, 500 tonnes of molybdenum (as wulfenite), and 172 tonnes of germanium.   

Current Status: Exploration Focus on Germanium: The dormant mine complex is now the subject of intense modern exploration. The exploration licenses are held by a joint venture between Canadian company MultiMet and the Australian-listed Battery Age Minerals (ASX: BM8). The strategic focus of this exploration has pivoted dramatically from the historic bulk commodities of lead and zinc to the high-value critical mineral Germanium. A review of previously unpublished historical data revealed that concentrates produced during the mine's final phase of operation contained exceptionally high germanium grades of up to 1,500 grams per tonne (g/t). Furthermore, recent analysis has confirmed the presence of the valuable Germanium-76 (Ge 
76
 ) isotope, which is vital for advanced semiconductors and defense applications.   

Strategic Importance: The Bleiberg project is positioned as a potentially secure, European-based source of germanium at a time of heightened geopolitical tension over critical mineral supply chains, particularly following China's 2024 export restrictions on the metal. The high grades discovered suggest the material could potentially be suitable for direct chemical refining, bypassing conventional zinc smelting and offering significant economic and environmental advantages. Battery Age Minerals is advancing the project with plans for a maiden drilling program in 2025 and is actively evaluating the potential for reprocessing historic tailings and concentrate stockpiles.   

Legacy: While the industrial mining has ceased, the district's heritage is preserved through popular tourist attractions, including the "Terra Mystica" and "Terra Montana" show mines, which offer guided underground tours of the historic workings.   

4.2 Other Notable Historic Mining Districts
Austria's landscape is dotted with numerous other historic mining districts, many of which were significant producers in their time and could hold potential for future re-evaluation.

Mitterberg Copper District (Salzburg): This is one of Europe's most ancient mining sites, with evidence of copper extraction dating back 4,000 years to the Bronze Age. Modern mining took place intermittently until the final closure in 1977. The primary ores were chalcopyrite and tennantite. The district is also notable for significant uranium mineralization, with nodules of pitchblende found in some veins.   

Schwaz-Brixlegg Silver-Copper District (Tyrol): During the late Middle Ages, this extensive mining district was a global center of silver production, making it one of the largest in Europe. The wealth was derived from silver-rich tetrahedrite ores (known locally as Fahlerz). Copper was also a major product, extracted from chalcopyrite and a host of secondary copper minerals. The district comprises numerous individual mines and adits, such as those at Falkenstein and Maukenötz.   

Neufinkenstein-Grabanz Mining District (Carinthia): A historic lead-zinc mining area located at Mallestiger Mittagskogel. While smaller than Bleiberg, it is mineralogically significant as the type locality for the rare mineral Mallestigite, which was first discovered and described here.   

Lassing Talc Mine (Styria): This underground talc mine was a significant producer until it was closed following a catastrophic mining accident involving a massive mudslide in 1998, which tragically claimed the lives of ten miners.   

4.3 Current Exploration Landscape
The primary focus of modern, high-profile mineral exploration in Austria is on critical raw materials essential for the energy transition and high-technology sectors.

Wolfsberg Lithium Project (Carinthia): This is currently Austria's most advanced exploration project for a battery metal. Located in Weinebene, the project is 100% owned by the Australian company European Lithium Ltd. It comprises a mining license and numerous exploration licenses covering a hard-rock lithium deposit (spodumene). The project has defined a JORC-compliant resource of 10.98 million tonnes at a grade of 1% lithium oxide (Li

​
 O). European Lithium is progressing through feasibility studies with the goal of establishing a mine and processing plant to produce battery-grade lithium hydroxide, aiming to supply the burgeoning European electric vehicle and battery storage industries.   

Other Exploration: In addition to the major projects at Bleiberg and Wolfsberg, other exploration activities are ongoing. These include projects such as Noricum Gold's exploration for copper and gold at sites like Walchen, which is reported to be one of the largest volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) deposits in Austria.   

The re-evaluation of historic sites like Bleiberg for new-economy minerals demonstrates a significant strategic advantage for Austria. The country's long and well-documented mining past provides a treasure trove of geological data, maps, and production records housed in archives like those of GeoSphere Austria. This historical information, combined with the existence of old mine workings that can provide underground access, substantially de-risks the initial, most expensive stages of exploration. Modern exploration companies can leverage this legacy to target specific areas for minerals like germanium, lithium, or cobalt that were previously ignored or undervalued. This "brownfield" exploration model is a lower-risk, potentially higher-reward strategy that positions Austria to potentially develop new domestic sources of the very minerals most critical for Europe's future.
