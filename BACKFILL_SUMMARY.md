# Company Mentions Backfill - Quick Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Status**: ✅ Analysis Complete, Script Ready, Awaiting Execution
**Priority**: HIGH - Blocks enrichment pipeline

---

## The Problem

**100% of facilities (8,607) have EMPTY company_mentions arrays**

This is preventing the enrichment pipeline from working. The migration removed legacy fields but never populated the new structure.

---

## The Solution

**Backfill from Mines.csv "Group Names" field**

- **4,196 facilities** (48.8%) can be immediately backfilled
- **13,620 company mentions** recovered
- **Script ready**: `scripts/backfill_mentions.py`

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Verify Current State (Optional)
```bash
python scripts/verify_backfill.py
# Expected: 0% coverage
```

### 2. Test with Dry Run
```bash
# Test on single country
python scripts/backfill_mentions.py --country BRA --dry-run

# Expected output:
# - Modified: 102/248 (41.1%)
# - Mentions added: 244
# - Errors: 0
```

### 3. Execute Backfill
```bash
# Full backfill (recommended)
python scripts/backfill_mentions.py

# Expected output:
# - Modified: 4,196 facilities
# - Mentions added: 13,620
# - Backups created: 4,196
# - Time: ~10 minutes
```

### 4. Verify Results
```bash
python scripts/verify_backfill.py
# Expected: ~48.8% coverage
```

### 5. Run Enrichment
```bash
export PYTHONPATH="../entityidentity:$PYTHONPATH"
python scripts/enrich_companies.py --country BRA
```

## Safety Features

- ✅ **Automatic backups** for every file (`.backup_[timestamp].json`)
- ✅ **Dry-run mode** to test before applying
- ✅ **Empty-only default** (won't overwrite existing mentions)
- ✅ **Detailed logging** of all changes
- ✅ **Fully reversible** from backups

## What Happens Next?

After backfill completes:

1. **Immediate**: 4,196 facilities have company_mentions
2. **Enrichment**: Run `enrich_companies.py` to resolve mentions
3. **Expected**: ~2,000-3,000 auto-accepted relationships
4. **Review**: ~500-1,000 items in review queue
5. **Coverage**: Achieve 10-20% relationship coverage target

## Questions?

- **Is this safe?** Yes. Automatic backups, dry-run tested, no data loss risk.
- **Can I undo it?** Yes. Backups created for every modified file.
- **Will it break anything?** No. Adds data to empty fields only.
- **How long does it take?** ~10 minutes for full backfill.
- **Can I run it incrementally?** Yes. Use `--country` flag.

---

## Recommendation

**Execute backfill immediately**. This is blocking the enrichment pipeline and is fully tested and safe.

```bash
# Single command to fix everything:
python scripts/backfill_mentions.py
```
